1
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,508
Hey!

2
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,079
...a dark
and stormy Halloween.

3
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:08,086
Good evening and welcome to
GC-1 News live at- 00.

4
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,712
Our top story tonight,

5
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,047
just-released polls

6
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,549
have incumbent
Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.

7
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,092
and 28-year-old
grassroots challenger

8
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,969
Bella Real in a dead heat.

9
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,762
Things certainly
got hot last night

10
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:21,099
in their final debate before
next Tuesday's election.

11
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,892
Now, my young opponent here

12
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,186
wants to gut
the Gotham Renewal Program,

13
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,105
established by
the great Thomas Wayne.

14
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,898
Cutting funds
from vital projects

15
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,316
like our seawall,

16
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,484
and the safety net
for those who need it.

17
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,403
The Renewal Program is broken.

18
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,572
This city's been renewing
for 20 years.

19
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,533
Look where it's gotten us.
Crime has skyrocketed.

20
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,993
Murder and drug use
are at historic highs.

21
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,578
Now wait... Now hang on.

22
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,413
We have a masked vigilante
running the street.

23
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,831
Under my administration,

24
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,416
the Gotham PD
has dealt major blows

25
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,418
to organized crime
and drug trafficking.

26
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,919
The Salvatore Maroni case

27
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,838
was the biggest drug bust
in city history.

28
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,132
But drops and other drugs
are still rampant.

29
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,592
-It's gotten worse.
-I'm not saying...

30
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,843
I'm not saying
there isn't work to do.

31
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,469
-But listen...

32
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,929
...I have a beautiful wife
and young son, okay?

33
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,055
-And I will not rest...

34
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,352
Hey.

35
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,565
Yeah, I'm watching it now.

36
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,655
Why is she still tied?

37
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,868
But...

38
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:25,246
But I thought we were getting
a bump in the new Post poll.

39
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,463
Okay, you know what?

40
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,839
I can't...
I can't watch this anymore.

41
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,674
Just call me
in the morning, okay?

42
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,137
...who still believes

43
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,639
in everything
this city can do.

44
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,723
We need a leader,
Mr. Mitchell,

45
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,308
not a cheerleader.

46
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,644
And someone who will
tell the people the truth.

47
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,892
Thursday, October 31st.

48
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,158
The city streets
are crowded for the holiday.

49
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,912
Even with the rain.

50
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:37,712
Hidden in the chaos
is the element

51
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,964
waiting to strike like snakes.

52
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,967
But I'm there too.

53
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,720
Watching.

54
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,015
Two years of nights

55
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:51,684
have turned me
into a nocturnal animal.

56
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,859
I must choose
my targets carefully.

57
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,290
Come on!

58
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,250
-Give me the money.
-Okay.

59
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,044
{\an5}-Let's go! Let's go!
All right, all right!

60
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,712
It's a big city.

61
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,052
I can't be everywhere.

62
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:38,523
But they don't know
where I am.

63
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,446
-Look at this guy, man.

64
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,204
-Boom!
-Whoo-hoo-hoo!

65
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,501
So good, man.
That's what I'm talking about!

66
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,044
Yo, let's see your hits.

67
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,255
That's you.

68
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:26,612
We have a signal now.
For when I'm needed.

69
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,284
But when that light
hits the sky,

70
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,452
it's not just a call.

71
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,581
It's a warning.

72
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,375
To them.

73
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,887
Fear...

74
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,391
...is a tool.

75
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,862
Are you
out of your mind?

76
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,655
Watch where you're goin',
drophead!

77
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,961
They think
I'm hiding in the shadows.

78
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,007
-Come on!

79
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,309
But I am the shadows.

80
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,120
Come on, come on.

81
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,081
Whoo.

82
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,374
-Hey, go on, man! Go!
-Get him!

83
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,668
-Come on, man!
-What are you doin'?

84
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,086
-Help!

85
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,420
Somebody help me!

86
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,215
Help, help!

87
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,515
Where you goin', huh?

88
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,772
-Come on.
-Come on, man. Break it.

89
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,567
You can't move, huh?

90
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,361
Now knock his ass out.

91
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,655
Showtime. Showtime, man.

92
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,823
Come on, man.

93
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,199
Come on. Do it, man.

94
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,361
You see this guy?

95
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,953
The hell are you
supposed to be?

96
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,263
I'm vengeance.

97
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,266
Holy shit. It's him.

98
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,335
Hey, man. No, no, no!

99
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,169
Please don't hurt me.

100
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,915
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

101
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,960
Police action.

102
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,795
He's with me, Officer.

103
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,341
Are you kidding me, sir?

104
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,844
You're gonna let him in here?

105
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,805
Martinez, let him through.

106
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,321
Goddamn freak.

107
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,087
What do we know?

108
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,558
Detective?

109
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,894
Sorry, Lieutenant.

110
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:37,233
We got blunt force trauma.
Lacerations on the head.

111
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,611
He got hit a lot of times.
And hard.

112
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,783
All this blood
is from his head?

113
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:46,867
No.

114
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,414
Excuse me.

115
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,585
Most of it's from his hand.

116
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,092
Thumb was severed.

117
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,012
Killer may have taken it
as a trophy.

118
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,181
He was alive
when it was cut off.

119
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:13,018
Ecchymosis

120
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,687
around the wound.

121
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,287
Security detail downstairs

122
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,914
said the family was out
trick-or-treatin'.

123
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,626
The mayor was up here alone.

124
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:42,756
Killer may have come
through the skylight.

125
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:50,806
You said
there was a card.

126
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:52,558
Yeah.

127
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:05,738
"From your
secret friend. Whoo?

128
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,616
Haven't a clue?

129
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,994
Let's play a game,
just me and you.

130
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,788
What does a liar do
when he's dead?"

131
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,208
There's a cipher too.

132
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,842
Any of this
mean anything to you?

133
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,596
What's going on here?

134
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,975
I asked him to come, Pete.

135
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,852
This is a crime scene.

136
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:39,188
It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!

137
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,148
I got the press downstairs.

138
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,067
You know, I cut you
a lot of slack, Jim,

139
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,109
'cause we got history.

140
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,070
But this is way over the line.

141
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,075
Wait.

142
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,618
-He's involved in this?
-No, he's not involved.

143
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:53,994
How do you know?

144
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,830
He's a goddamn vigilante!
He could be a suspect!

145
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,540
What are you doin' to me?
We used to be partners.

146
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,417
I'm just trying
to find the connection, Pete.

147
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,086
He lies still.

148
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:04,588
Excuse me?

149
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,549
The riddle.

150
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,927
What does a liar do
when he's dead?

151
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,220
He lies still.

152
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,814
Oh, Jesus.

153
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,861
This must be your favorite
night of the year, huh, pal?

154
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,240
Happy fuckin' Halloween.

155
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,951
Excuse me,
Commissioner.

156
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,869
They're ready
for your statement.

157
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,625
I want him outta here.

158
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,335
Now!

159
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,135
Come on.

160
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,107
Yeah.

161
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,776
The kid found him.

162
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,782
Was there anyone else

163
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,784
in the house when you arrived?

164
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,386
We really gotta go, man.

165
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:44,062
Tonight,
a son lost a father.

166
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,064
A wife lost a husband.

167
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,485
And I lost a friend.

168
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,112
Mayor Mitchell was a fighter
for the city,

169
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,657
and I will not rest
until his killer is found.

170
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,660
This was
a truly senseless crime,

171
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,037
and we are actively pursuing

172
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,122
every investigative lead
we have

173
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,875
in order to identify
the perpetrator

174
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,335
and hunt him down.

175
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,003
I've spoken to the governor...

176
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:10,631
I wish I could say
I'm making a difference,

177
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,257
but I don't know.

178
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,974
Murder, robberies, assault.

179
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,936
Two years later,
they're all up.

180
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,395
And now this.

181
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,149
The city's eating itself.

182
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,111
Maybe it's beyond saving.

183
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,491
But I have to try.

184
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,660
Push myself.

185
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,417
These nights
all roll together in a rush,

186
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,295
behind the mask.

187
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,093
Sometimes in the morning,

188
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,014
I have to force myself
to remember

189
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,976
everything that happened.

190
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,241
Unbelievable breaking news

191
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,868
this hour, everyone.

192
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,829
Again, four-term incumbent
Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.

193
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,749
was found murdered last night
inside his home

194
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,626
in the exclusive
Crest Hill district.

195
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,669
Exact details of the crime

196
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,171
still have not been released,

197
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,924
but a citywide manhunt
is already underway

198
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:20,260
as police and FBI search
for the brazen killer.

199
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,387
And this certainly
is not the first time

200
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,764
Gotham has been rocked

201
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,223
by the murder
of a political figure.

202
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,100
In fact,
in an eerie coincidence,

203
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,227
it was 20 years ago this week

204
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,896
that celebrated
billionaire philanthropist

205
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,940
Dr. Thomas Wayne
and his wife Martha

206
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:36,026
were slain during Wayne's
own mayoral campaign.

207
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,402
It was a shocking crime

208
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,821
that remains unsolved
to this day.

209
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,740
Don Mitchell, Jr.'s
political career

210
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:44,576
was especially notable
for his tough war on drugs

211
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,911
when he and city police

212
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,913
launched a major
sting operation

213
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,539
resulting in the arrest

214
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,959
of notorious mafia crime
figure Salvatore Maroni,

215
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,543
with what, to this day,

216
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,213
remains the biggest drug bust
in GCPD history.

217
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,589
I assume you heard about this.

218
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:00,926
-Yeah.

219
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,726
Oh, I see.

220
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,979
All this
blood is from his head?

221
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,730
Dear God.

222
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,533
There's a cipher too.

223
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,460
Any of this
mean anything to you?

224
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,798
The killer left this
for the Batman?

225
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,843
I asked him to come, Pete.

226
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,052
Apparently.

227
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,138
You're becoming
quite a celebrity.

228
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,349
Why is he writing to you?

229
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,976
It's Mitchell,
for chrissakes!

230
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,310
I don't know yet.

231
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,729
I got the press
downstairs.

232
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,024
Have a shower.

233
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,027
Our accounting friends
at Wayne Enterprises

234
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,194
are coming for breakfast.

235
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,988
Here? Why?

236
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,740
Because I couldn't get you
to go there.

237
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,242
-I haven't got time for this.
-It's getting serious, Bruce.

238
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:08,577
If this continues,

239
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,412
it won't be long
before you've nothing left.

240
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,164
I don't care about that.

241
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,124
Any of that.

242
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,542
You don't care
about your family's legacy?

243
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:21,089
What I'm doing
is my family's legacy.

244
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,759
If I can't change things here,

245
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,720
if I can't have an effect,

246
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,597
then I don't care
what happens to me.

247
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,806
That's what I'm afraid of.

248
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,433
Alfred, stop.

249
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,311
You're not my father.

250
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,523
I'm well aware.

251
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,060
We really gotta go, man.

252
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,462
Some fresh berries there.

253
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:50,762
What are you doing?

254
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:55,016
Just reminiscing about my days
in the Circus.

255
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,104
This is
actually quite elusive.

256
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,608
Where'd you get those O's?

257
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,946
"He lies still"
is only a partial key.

258
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,365
It only gives us
H, E, L, I, S, and T.

259
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:13,618
So, I'm looking for
any double symbols to start,

260
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:14,786
trying letters,

261
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,204
see where it leads.

262
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,082
That's interesting.

263
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,751
Mr. Pennyworth?

264
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,003
Yes, Dory?

265
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,546
The accountants are here.

266
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,548
See them in, please, Dory.

267
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,720
What if
it's not a partial key?

268
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,263
What do you mean?

269
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:35,849
What if this is the whole key?

270
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,518
Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.

271
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,145
Use only the letters
from "He lies still"

272
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,897
-and leave the rest...
-Blank. Yeah, I understand.

273
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,232
But that would leave
most of the cipher unsolved.

274
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,067
I don't see
how that's gonna...

275
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:49,738
Oh.

276
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,920
Damn.

277
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:08,256
Yeah, he's got a car.

278
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,800
Guess it's good
to be the mayor.

279
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,802
Where to even start?

280
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:15,764
You sure this isn't a leap?
"Drive" could mean anything.

281
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,432
You don't trust me?

282
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:19,184
You mean like you trust me?

283
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,477
It's been two years now,

284
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,229
and I don't even know
who you are, man.

285
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,232
There.

286
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,215
What are we looking for?

287
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,883
A USB port.

288
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,051
USB?

289
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,351
What?

290
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,984
"Thumb" drive.

291
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,403
Jesus.

292
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,533
It's encrypted.

293
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,246
Try this.

294
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,588
Oh, this guy's hilarious.

295
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,309
Oh, well, well, well.

296
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,769
So much for family values.

297
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,146
Who is she?

298
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,356
No idea.

299
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,526
But that's the Penguin,
Carmine Falcone's right hand.

300
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:53,653
-I know who he is.

301
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:54,779
What was that?

302
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:59,868
Shit, shit, shit! The drive.

303
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,329
It sent out the photos
from my account.

304
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:05,206
Gotham Post, Gazette,
GC-1, all of them.

305
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,000
Jesus.

306
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,711
I'm gonna catch hell for this.
Pete's gonna bust a gasket.

307
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,296
"He lies still."

308
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,464
About her?

309
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,300
Maybe.

310
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,177
That's the Iceberg Lounge.

311
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,680
It's under the Shoreline Lofts
where Falcone was holed up.

312
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,058
Never get in there
without a warrant.

313
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:26,478
Yeah.

314
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,784
Know who I am?

315
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,662
Yeah. I got an idea.

316
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,706
I want to see the Penguin.

317
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,209
I don't know what
you're talking about, pal.

318
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,632
What's the problem?

319
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,008
Says he wants
to see the Penguin.

320
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,135
Penguin?
There's no Penguin here.

321
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,845
That's what
I tried to tell him.

322
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,139
Get out of here, freak.
You hear me?

323
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,350
Or that little suit's
gonna get all full of blood.

324
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:07,811
Mine or yours?

325
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,028
Get him!

326
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,279
I saw that whole thing.

327
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,531
He's over there!

328
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,074
What is your problem?

329
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,453
Yo!

330
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,869
Hey! Put the bat down,
or I'll blow your head off!

331
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,797
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

332
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,008
Take it easy, sweetheart.

333
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,510
You looking for me?

334
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,180
I see you met the twins.

335
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:28,850
Boy, you're everything
they say, ain't ya?

336
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,227
I guess we both are.

337
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,190
How you doing?

338
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,609
I'm Oz.

339
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,448
Who is she?

340
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,912
I really don't know, chief.

341
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:52,040
I might have been coming out
at the same time,

342
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,291
but I wasn't rolling
with them.

343
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,931
It's okay, baby.

344
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:11,976
Mr. Vengeance here,
he don't bite. Come on.

345
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,546
Thank you, honey.

346
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,136
Here you go, champ.

347
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,055
I wanna know who she is,

348
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,848
and what she has to do
with this murder.

349
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,101
-Whose murder?
-The mayor's.

350
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,477
Is that the mayor?

351
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,479
Oh, shit, it is. Look at that.

352
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:58,940
Don't make me hurt you.

353
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:03,152
You better watch it.
You know my reputation?

354
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:06,281
Yeah, I do. Do you?

355
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,534
Look...

356
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:14,247
I'm just the proprietor, okay?

357
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,583
I mean, what people do here

358
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,710
ain't got nothing to do
with me.

359
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,595
Tell you one thing.

360
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:34,642
Whoever she is,
she's one hot chick.

361
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,227
Why don't you ask
Mitchell's wife?

362
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,353
Maybe she knows.

363
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,400
What? Too soon?

364
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:55,413
You let me know if there's
anything else I can do.

365
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:04,922
Taxi!

366
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,426
Taxi!

367
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,071
Hey, it's me.

368
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,240
Baby, what's wrong?

369
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,785
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down,
slow down. I can't...

370
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,039
On the news?

371
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,459
Okay. No. No, stay there.
Wait for me, okay?

372
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,127
Wait for me,
I'm on my way home.

373
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,880
Listen, baby,

374
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:48,549
we're gonna get the hell
out of here, okay? I promise.

375
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:52,095
If we have to leave earlier,
we'll leave tonight.

376
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,388
-Uh...

377
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,141
God damn it.

378
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,079
...photos
of murdered mayor,

379
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,915
Don Mitchell, Jr.
with a younger mystery woman.

380
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:22,417
In a shocking development,

381
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,918
the police believe
the photos themselves...

382
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:00,329
Now they urge her
to contact the GCPD...

383
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,257
You're pretty good at that.

384
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,749
Hey! Give me that.

385
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,796
"Kosolov, Annika."

386
00:36:57,214 --> 00:36:59,300
He hurt her?
That's why you killed him?

387
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,178
What? Oh, please.
Just give me the goddamn...

388
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:43,052
Listen, honey,
you got the wrong idea, okay?

389
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,554
I didn't kill anybody.
I'm here for my friend.

390
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,098
She's trying to get
the hell out of here,

391
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,100
and this son of a bitch
stole her passport.

392
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,476
What does she know?

393
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,602
Whatever it is,
it's got her so spooked

394
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:52,770
she won't even tell me.

395
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,397
She did seem upset.

396
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,692
Back at your place.

397
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,237
Let's go talk to her.

398
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,472
Anni!

399
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:30,850
Baby!

400
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,519
Anni!

401
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,275
Anni!

402
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,570
It's gonna
be cool this evening.

403
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,197
It's gonna be down
into the 40s.

404
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,033
More
breaking news this hour,

405
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:50,786
as the city is rocked by
a second high-profile murder

406
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,288
in as many nights.

407
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,581
And this time, the killer
has come forward

408
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,790
to claim credit online...

409
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,250
Jesus, what are they
gonna do to her?

410
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,626
She's just a kid.

411
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,422
-Shit, they took my phone.
-His victim,

412
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,590
longtime head
of the Gotham City PD,

413
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,091
Commissioner Pete Savage,

414
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,177
was found dead
earlier tonight

415
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,179
inside the Police
Athletic League facilities

416
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,680
in the Tricorner area.

417
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,974
The killer posted
the following message

418
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,684
on social media,

419
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,895
and we have to warn you,
the video is very disturbing.

420
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,778
Hello, people of Gotham.

421
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,946
This is the Riddler speaking.

422
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:28,991
On Halloween night,

423
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,451
I killed your mayor

424
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:34,038
because he was not
who he pretended to be.

425
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,791
But I am not done.

426
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,337
Here is another...

427
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,469
...who will soon
be losing face.

428
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:54,141
I will kill again,
and again, and again

429
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,893
until our day of judgment

430
00:39:55,976 --> 00:40:01,816
when the truth about our city
will finally

431
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,026
be unmasked.

432
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,238
Goodbye!

433
00:40:11,408 --> 00:40:12,827
{\an8}
Commissioner Savage served

434
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,329
{\an8}a distinguished 30-year career
on the GCPD...

435
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,748
Holy shit,
I seen that guy, too.

436
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,417
At the club.

437
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,170
The Iceberg Lounge?

438
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,381
44 Below.

439
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,300
What is that?

440
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,097
The club within the club.

441
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,100
The real club.

442
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,437
It's a mob hangout.

443
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,981
Is that where you work?

444
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,359
Selina?

445
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,658
No, I just work
the bar upstairs.

446
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,663
But I see 'em come in.

447
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,206
Who?

448
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,374
A lot of guys
that shouldn't be there,

449
00:41:00,457 --> 00:41:01,834
I can tell you that.

450
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,255
Your basic
upstanding citizen types.

451
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,050
You're gonna help me on this.

452
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,219
For your friend.

453
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,148
You got a lot of cats.

454
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,568
I have a thing about strays.

455
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,032
You're not safe here.

456
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,117
I can take care of myself.

457
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,577
Two public figures

458
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,078
now dead in just
the last two nights,

459
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,747
and only days
before the election.

460
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,081
Police and city officials

461
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,958
are left searching
for a killer

462
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:46,212
and hoping to find him
before he kills again.

463
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:08,108
He waited for him at the gym.

464
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,319
Pete always liked
to work out late at night,

465
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:13,489
when no one else was around.

466
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,074
There's a needle mark
on his neck.

467
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,201
Injected him with arsenic.

468
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,538
Rat poison.

469
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,873
Yeah.

470
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,960
That seems to be
his theme here.

471
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,336
Look at this thing.

472
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:37,179
It's a maze.

473
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,433
What kind of demented
son of a bitch

474
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,185
does this to a person?

475
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,022
More symbols.

476
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:50,859
It's another cipher.

477
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:54,321
He blasted these out
after his message went viral.

478
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,032
Bastard murders you
and your reputation.

479
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:00,411
That guy pushes drops.
On the east end.

480
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,372
I don't get it.

481
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,791
Why would Pete get involved
in something like this?

482
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,627
Looks like he got greedy.

483
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,045
You kidding me?

484
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,464
After everything we did
to take down the Maronis?

485
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:13,924
We busted
their entire operation,

486
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,926
then he caves
to some lowlife dealer?

487
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,220
Maybe he's not
who you thought.

488
00:43:19,596 --> 00:43:21,807
You make it sound
like he had it coming.

489
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,519
He was a cop.

490
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,147
Crossed a line.

491
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,804
"I'm mad about you.

492
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:04,767
Want to know my name?
Just look inside and see."

493
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:14,818
"Follow the maze
until you find the rat.

494
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:18,697
Bring him into the light,
and you'll find where I'm at."

495
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,991
The hell is that?

496
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:24,453
"Bring him into the light"?
"Find the rat"?

497
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,081
I don't know.

498
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,083
Lieutenant.

499
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,459
They're coming back.

500
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,127
We got
to get out of here.

501
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:37,508
Come on.

502
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:43,680
Ow.

503
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,433
I don't know
about these things.

504
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,978
I need to see in there,
this hunting ground.

505
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:56,652
Hey, why am I starting to feel
like a fish on a hook?

506
00:44:58,445 --> 00:44:59,988
I'm just looking for Annika.

507
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:06,745
Boy, you're a real sweetheart.

508
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,205
You really don't care
what happens to me

509
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:09,540
in there tonight, do you?

510
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,384
Look at me.

511
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,187
Looks good. Here.

512
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,316
I got you. Can you hear me?

513
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,276
Yeah.

514
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,411
Hey, where you goin'?

515
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,205
Hospitality.

516
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,623
That's one of the guys

517
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,249
I got into it with
the other night.

518
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,419
Looks like I broke his nose.

519
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,220
"Kenzie, William."

520
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,846
He's an off-duty cop.

521
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,558
Are you sure no one can see
these things in my eyes?

522
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,769
Don't worry. I'm watching you.

523
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,539
Don't look away.
I need time to make IDs.

524
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:14,623
Great.

525
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:22,923
These guys
have a little problem

526
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,216
with eye contact, don't they?

527
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:25,717
Feels good, doesn't it?

528
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:28,136
Yeah, baby.
Feels real good.

529
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,769
Jesus,
I hate dropheads.

530
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:36,812
Really?

531
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,272
'Cause when I first saw you,

532
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,773
it looked like you were
dealing for Penguin.

533
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:40,649
You don't know
what you're talking about.

534
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,025
Can we not...

535
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,986
Can we not do this right now?

536
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:47,531
Wait. Who was that?

537
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:48,574
Oh, I saw him.

538
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,117
Look back.

539
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,743
If I look back, it's gonna be
a whole can of worms.

540
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,120
I need to see his face.

541
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,248
Jesus.

542
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,382
That's the DA.

543
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:06,550
Gil Colson.

544
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,302
And he's coming over.
You happy?

545
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,595
Talk to him.

546
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:13,765
Hey. How you doing?

547
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,892
-Hi.
-I'm Gil.

548
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:19,688
-Hey, aren't you the DA?
-Yeah.

549
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:22,107
Wow.
I've seen you on TV.

550
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,775
Is that right?

551
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,987
I haven't seen you
around here before.

552
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,114
It's a hell of a time
to be the new girl

553
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:31,658
'cause people
are all a little on edge.

554
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,243
Oh, honey,
I live on the edge.

555
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,703
-Is that right?

556
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:36,246
I like that.

557
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,581
Do you want to come over?

558
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:38,665
Sure.

559
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,003
-This is Travis.
-Hey.

560
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,546
You wanna take a seat
over there?

561
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,673
-Richie, Glen.
-Hey.

562
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,509
That's half the DA's office.

563
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:50,844
You know Carla here, huh?

564
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,638
-Hi.
-That's Cheri. Don't mind her,

565
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,014
she's just taking a break.

566
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,183
Drowning our sorrows.

567
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:57,601
You want a drop?

568
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:59,686
Uh, no, I'm good.
But you enjoy.

569
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,148
Hope you don't mind.

570
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,483
I got a lot on my shoulders

571
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:05,859
with that psycho
running around.

572
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:06,943
He's wasted.

573
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,528
No shit.

574
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,031
I like this girl.

575
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,741
Oh, hey, I like you, too!

576
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:17,871
I mean, this Riddler,

577
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:19,539
he's going after the most
powerful people in the city.

578
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,874
He knows so much.

579
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:22,250
He doesn't
know shit, man.

580
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,627
What are you
talking about?

581
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,045
Yeah, he does!
What about that rat...

582
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,672
Hey, hey,
Gil, come on.

583
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,340
-Hey. The rat.
-Think maybe you had

584
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:29,549
-a little too much. Slow down.
-Ask him about the rat.

585
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,387
Hey,
what's this about a rat?

586
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,482
I mean,

587
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:49,611
there was a rat.
We had an informant.

588
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:52,114
We had big-time information
on Salvatore Maroni.

589
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:53,949
That's how we got him out of
the drops business.

590
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:55,575
He's talking about
the Maroni case.

591
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:59,496
But if this guy knows,
it's gonna come out.

592
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:00,914
And when it does,

593
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:02,040
this whole city's
gonna come apart.

594
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,917
Okay, I don't wanna hear this.

595
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,419
This is
the kind of pillow talk

596
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,753
that got that Russian girl
disappeared.

597
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,381
What do you know about that?

598
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:11,967
-Does anybody want a drink?
-I want a drink.

599
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,343
Keep him talking.

600
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,598
-Wait, where are you going?
-She knows Annika.

601
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,975
No, stay on the DA.

602
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:22,144
I told you
I'm looking for my friend.

603
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:25,105
Where's Annika?

604
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,523
Out of my face.
I don't know you.

605
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:27,816
Yeah, but you know her.
Who took her?

606
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:29,317
What have you heard?
Is she okay?

607
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,527
Jesus Christ,
keep your voice down.

608
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,903
What, you got a death wish?

609
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,822
Hey,
what's the problem, ladies?

610
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:36,783
There's no problem.
It's just girl talk.

611
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,452
Let's keep it festive
down here, all right?

612
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:39,745
Sure thing, Oz.

613
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:45,542
Hey.

614
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,128
Hey.

615
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:51,548
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

616
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,050
How you been?

617
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,096
Yeah, I've been okay.

618
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:00,807
I was just, um...

619
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,644
I was just headed back
upstairs.

620
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,438
Mm. Well,

621
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:09,191
don't be a stranger.

622
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:25,415
-You know Carmine Falcone.
-I told you it's a mob spot.

623
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,000
You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.

624
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:29,002
I don't have a relationship
with him, okay?

625
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:30,504
Well, that's not
what it looked like.

626
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,255
-Forget it.
-Wait, what are you doing?

627
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,507
Listen,
I can't do this anymore.

628
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,674
No! No!

629
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:40,305
Taxi!

630
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,310
Hey!

631
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,063
I lost you in there.

632
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:49,272
Yeah, I gotta go.

633
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:52,108
Oh, you need a ride?

634
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,485
That's me right there.

635
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,700
Taxi!

636
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:01,910
I'm good.

637
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,288
I hope, uh...

638
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,461
-I'll see you around.

639
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:41,343
Just hold still.

640
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,736
What do you know
about a confidential informant

641
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,196
in the Maroni case?

642
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,785
Yeah, sure, there was.

643
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:51,538
That's the rat
we're looking for.

644
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,957
Somehow
Riddler knows who he is.

645
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,210
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

646
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:58,753
Where are you getting this?

647
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:01,715
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

648
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:04,634
Gil's very nervous.

649
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:07,429
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

650
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:09,305
I worked that case.

651
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:12,726
-Riddler's not after you.
-How do you know?

652
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,310
You're not corrupt.

653
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:16,896
Colson's dirty?

654
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,654
Maybe I, uh...

655
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:28,158
I go after him. Lean on him
to give up the rat.

656
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:29,534
It's too dangerous.

657
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:32,120
They made a secret deal
with this guy.

658
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:34,080
Who knows how many people
it touches.

659
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:38,501
Politicians. Police.
The courts.

660
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,587
It could tear
the whole city apart.

661
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,922
Jesus,
this is a powder keg.

662
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:46,885
And Riddler's the match.

663
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:48,428
You know Carmine Falcone.

664
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,305
I told you
it's a mob spot.

665
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:51,973
You didn't tell me you
had a relationship with him.

666
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:52,932
I don't have
a relationship...

667
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,436
You didn't tell me you
had a relationship with him.

668
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:57,604
I don't have
a relationship with him.

669
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:58,897
-Okay?

670
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,398
You know
Carmine Falcone.

671
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,275
I told you
it's a mob spot.

672
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:04,194
You didn't tell me you
had a relationship with him.

673
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:05,612
{\an5}I don't have
a relationship
with him. Okay?

674
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:06,654
-Pretty.

675
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,866
She a new friend of yours?

676
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:15,663
I'm not so sure.

677
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:18,291
Looks like you upset her.

678
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:20,668
Shall I take this
as a good sign?

679
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:22,629
-What?
-Your attire.

680
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,714
Is Bruce Wayne
making an actual appearance?

681
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,758
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

682
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:30,595
Serial killers like to follow
reactions to their crimes.

683
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:32,305
Riddler might not
be able to resist.

684
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:34,808
Oh, that reminds me.

685
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,602
I've taken the liberty
of doing a little work

686
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,437
on this latest cipher.

687
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,272
The one from the rat maze.

688
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:44,651
I'm afraid his Spanish
is not perfect,

689
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,694
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

690
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:50,573
"You are El Rata Alada."

691
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,242
Rata Alada?

692
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:53,368
"Rat with wings"?

693
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:54,577
It's slang for "pigeon."

694
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,162
Does that mean anything
to you?

695
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,372
Yeah.

696
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,166
A stool pigeon.

697
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,877
-Where are your cufflinks?
-I couldn't find them.

698
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:06,131
Well, you can't
go out like that.

699
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:08,174
Alfred, I don't want
your cufflinks.

700
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:14,180
You have to keep up
appearances.

701
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,599
-You're still a Wayne.

702
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,060
And what about you?
Are you a Wayne?

703
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,855
Your father gave them to me.

704
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:31,447
No more lies! No more lies!

705
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:34,742
No more lies! No more lies!

706
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:38,204
No more lies! No more lies!

707
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:41,749
No more lies! No more lies!

708
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:44,919
No more lies! No more lies!

709
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:48,715
No more lies! No more lies!

710
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,133
Mr. Wayne. All right.

711
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,510
All right, you're going
straight down there.

712
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,940
Is that Bruce Wayne?

713
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:08,610
Mr. Wayne!
Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!

714
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:18,912
Hold it.

715
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,497
You good, fellas?

716
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:23,082
Good.

717
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,294
We're good, Mr. Falcone.

718
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:45,104
Sir?

719
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:05,792
Hey!

720
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,794
Give us a wide berth here,
would you, slick?

721
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,797
Hey, watch it, fellas.

722
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,341
You got the prince
of the city there.

723
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:18,137
Some event, huh?

724
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,014
Brought out the one guy
in the city

725
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,307
more reclusive than me.

726
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,768
Thought you'd never leave
the Shoreline.

727
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:25,436
Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

728
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,689
Why? 'Cause your father
ain't around?

729
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,441
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

730
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,151
Wow, is that right?

731
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,904
His father saved my life.

732
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:38,324
I got shot in the chest.
Right here.

733
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,743
I couldn't go to no hospital,

734
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:43,079
so we showed up
on his doorstep.

735
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:46,374
Operated right
on the dining room table.

736
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:49,669
Kid here,
he saw the whole thing,

737
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,879
up on the stairs looking down.

738
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,300
I remember your face.

739
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,387
You don't think that meant
something, he did that?

740
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:01,764
It meant he took
the Hippocratic oath.

741
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,684
"Hippocratic oath."

742
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:08,855
That's good.

743
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,148
Excuse me.

744
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:14,610
Yes.

745
01:00:28,624 --> 01:00:30,209
Ladies and gentlemen,

746
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,794
thank you all for coming
to today's memorial

747
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,713
for our beloved mayor,
Don Mitchell, Jr.

748
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,673
Our program
will begin shortly.

749
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,383
As a reminder,
the family asked

750
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,885
that those wishing to honor
the mayor's memory

751
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,553
consider a donation
to the cause

752
01:00:40,636 --> 01:00:42,430
-most dear to his heart...

753
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:44,599
...the Gotham Renewal Fund,

754
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:46,142
our city's safety net.

755
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:49,771
What good's a safety net
doesn't catch anybody?

756
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:52,398
Didn't help my daughter
when she needed it,

757
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:53,775
I can tell you that.

758
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:57,111
The guy was just another
rich scum-sucker.

759
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:59,989
He got what he deserved.

760
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:02,867
Know what I mean?

761
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,245
Hey, don't I know you?

762
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,122
Bruce Wayne.

763
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:10,291
Why haven't
you called me back?

764
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:11,584
I'm sorry?

765
01:01:11,667 --> 01:01:13,961
I'm Bella Real.
I'm running for mayor.

766
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:15,588
I wouldn't be bothering
you here,

767
01:01:15,671 --> 01:01:18,007
but your people keep
telling me you're unavailable.

768
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,509
Will you walk with me?

769
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:25,973
Mr. Wayne.

770
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:27,683
Mr. Wayne.

771
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:31,437
You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.

772
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,189
Your family
has a history of philanthropy,

773
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:35,858
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.

774
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:39,028
If I'm elected,
I want to change that.

775
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:40,446
Thank you.

776
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,323
My God.

777
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:46,536
I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?

778
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:48,246
I want to continue this.

779
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:53,418
Excuse me.

780
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,338
I'm so sorry for your loss.

781
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:00,716
Thank you.

782
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,301
Excuse me, chief.
Can I talk to you?

783
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:05,471
Gil Colson is missing.

784
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:06,722
What?

785
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,183
He hasn't been heard from
since last night.

786
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:10,309
Christ, not again.

787
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,562
Hey. Mr. Wayne.

788
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:17,275
You got people
looking for him, Jim?

789
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:19,652
Sent a couple guys
to his house. Nothing.

790
01:02:19,735 --> 01:02:20,987
What'd his wife say?

791
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,155
She hadn't
heard from him.

792
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,461
Get out of the car!

793
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:20,922
Get out of the car
and show your hands!

794
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:23,674
Get out!

795
01:03:33,809 --> 01:03:35,061
Get 'em up!

796
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:36,979
Get out! Show 'em!

797
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:42,902
Christ, it's Colson.

798
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:44,529
There's a bomb
around his neck!

799
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:01,504
Let's clear
this place out now!

800
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:03,214
We've got to get
this place cleared out!

801
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:40,126
Hey, guys, guys.
Here we go.

802
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:44,839
We don't know
if he's in on it.

803
01:04:47,883 --> 01:04:49,176
What's he looking at?

804
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,197
Holy shit.

805
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:11,907
Are you kidding me?

806
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:15,494
What the hell is he doing?
Gordon!

807
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:18,205
Your guy's gonna get himself
killed in there.

808
01:05:33,929 --> 01:05:35,097
Please.

809
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:38,351
He made me do it.
I'm so sorry.

810
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:39,644
He told me if I didn't do

811
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:40,686
exactly what he said,
he'd kill me.

812
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:42,063
I'm so sorry.

813
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:43,856
Looks like a combination lock.

814
01:05:43,939 --> 01:05:45,983
Can't we just cut it off?

815
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:47,902
Not if you want
to keep your head.

816
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,815
You came.

817
01:06:27,608 --> 01:06:29,193
Who are you?

818
01:06:29,276 --> 01:06:30,277
Me?

819
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,281
I'm nobody.

820
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:38,077
I'm just an instrument,

821
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,870
here to unmask the truth

822
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:42,540
about this cesspool
we call a city.

823
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:44,125
"Unmask"?

824
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:46,043
Yes.

825
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:49,004
Let's do it together, okay?

826
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:52,091
I've been trying to reach you.

827
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:54,635
You're part of this, too.

828
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,554
How am I a part of this?

829
01:06:56,637 --> 01:06:58,264
You'll see.

830
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:00,099
Hey, Chief. You
better take a look at this.

831
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:02,435
Say hello to my followers.

832
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:03,894
{\an8}We're live.

833
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:06,689
{\an8}They're here to watch
our little trial.

834
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:09,150
{\an8}At the moment,

835
01:07:09,233 --> 01:07:12,695
{\an8}the man across
from you, Mr. Colson,

836
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:13,946
{\an8}is dead.

837
01:07:14,029 --> 01:07:15,656
Jesus, can we
get somebody out here?

838
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:16,991
-This psycho's gonna kill me!
-But wait a minute...

839
01:07:17,074 --> 01:07:18,451
Shut up!

840
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,119
You deserve to be dead
after what you did!

841
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:23,205
You hear me?

842
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:24,915
Okay.

843
01:07:32,923 --> 01:07:35,176
I'm giving you a chance.

844
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:39,096
No one ever gave me a chance.

845
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:42,975
Now,

846
01:07:43,058 --> 01:07:45,770
ever since I was a child,

847
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:49,982
I've always loved
little puzzles.

848
01:07:50,065 --> 01:07:52,485
For me, they are a retreat

849
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:55,946
from the horrors of our world.

850
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:58,199
Maybe they can bring

851
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:01,118
some comfort to you too,
Mr. Colson.

852
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:03,537
-You want me to do puzzles?

853
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:06,373
Three riddles in two minutes.

854
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:08,083
You give me the answers,

855
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:10,503
and I'll give you
the code for the lock.

856
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:13,005
-Do you understand?
-Yeah.

857
01:08:13,088 --> 01:08:15,174
Okay, okay. So I just...

858
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:16,801
-You want me to...

859
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:18,719
-Riddle number one...

860
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:20,554
-"It can be cruel,

861
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:22,431
poetic, or blind,

862
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:27,269
"but when it's denied,
it's violence you may find."

863
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:29,855
Wait, wait, wait!
Can you repeat that?

864
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:30,981
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

865
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:32,483
-"Justice."
-Huh?

866
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:33,651
The answer's "justice."

867
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:35,027
-Justice?
-Yes!

868
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:36,487
-Oh, God.
-Justice!

869
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:39,198
And you were supposed to be

870
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:40,950
an arm of justice
in this city,

871
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:43,536
along with the late mayor
and police commissioner,

872
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,913
were you not, Mr. Colson?

873
01:08:45,996 --> 01:08:47,331
Of course, of course.

874
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:49,542
- Of course.
-Riddle number two.

875
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:53,754
"If you are justice,
please do not lie.

876
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:58,050
"What is the price
for your blind eye?"

877
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,052
-"The price"?
-"Bribes."

878
01:09:00,135 --> 01:09:01,303
Oh, God. "Bribes"?

879
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:02,513
He's asking you
how much it cost

880
01:09:02,596 --> 01:09:03,639
for you to turn your back.

881
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:06,141
Fifty-eight seconds!

882
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:07,685
-How much?
-Nothing!

883
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:09,812
-How much?
-Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

884
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:11,105
I get a monthly payment

885
01:09:11,188 --> 01:09:12,481
just not to prosecute
certain cases.

886
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:13,899
-What cases?
-He didn't ask me that!

887
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,609
-Come on! Ten grand.

888
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:17,152
That's my answer.
It's ten grand!

889
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:18,612
Okay. Okay. Okay.

890
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:21,282
Don't lose your head,
Mr. Colson.

891
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:25,369
Just one more to go
before your time runs out.

892
01:09:25,452 --> 01:09:27,746
Last riddle.

893
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:32,084
"Since
your justice is so select,

894
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:36,589
please tell us which vermin
you're paid to protect."

895
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:38,799
-"Which vermin"?
-The rat.

896
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:40,050
The informant you all protect

897
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:41,468
from
the Salvatore Maroni case.

898
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:43,304
-How do you know about that?
-What's his name?

899
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:45,097
-Twenty seconds.
-No.

900
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:46,974
-He's gonna kill you.
-I'm a dead man either way.

901
01:09:47,057 --> 01:09:48,350
You're talking
to a dead man, okay?

902
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,102
If I go out this way,
it's just me.

903
01:09:50,185 --> 01:09:53,272
But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.

904
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:54,690
-He'll kill them, too.
-Who will?

905
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:56,275
-People are watching.
-What people?

906
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:58,319
It's so much bigger
than you could ever imagine.

907
01:09:58,402 --> 01:09:59,570
It's the whole system!

908
01:09:59,653 --> 01:10:01,530
{\an8}-Five! Four!

909
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:03,032
{\an8}-Oh, God, have mercy on me...
-Three!

910
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:05,034
-Goodbye!

911
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:37,024
Who do you
think he is under there?

912
01:10:37,107 --> 01:10:38,651
Take it easy.
I want to see.

913
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,111
What is that thing?
Leather?

914
01:10:44,865 --> 01:10:46,325
What's he got
on his eyes?

915
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:47,952
Who cares?
I want to see his face.

916
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:49,370
-We are we doing here?
-Let's just take it off...

917
01:10:49,453 --> 01:10:50,955
-Hey!

918
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:53,123
Hey! Hey! Hey!

919
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:54,166
Hey! Hey!

920
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,834
Relax, God damn it!

921
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:57,544
You're protecting
this guy, Jim?

922
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,799
He interfered in an active
hostage situation.

923
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:04,343
Colson's blood
is on his hands.

924
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:05,803
Maybe it's on yours.

925
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:08,180
What'd you say?

926
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:10,391
He would rather die than talk.

927
01:11:10,474 --> 01:11:12,059
What was he afraid of?

928
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:14,103
You?

929
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:22,695
You son of a bitch.

930
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:25,823
You have any idea what kind
of trouble you're in?

931
01:11:25,906 --> 01:11:27,533
You could be
an accessory to murder.

932
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:28,742
Why are we
playing games...

933
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:31,870
Get him! Come on!

934
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,747
Back off! Back off!

935
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:36,208
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!

936
01:11:36,291 --> 01:11:37,501
You got me
on assaulting three.

937
01:11:37,584 --> 01:11:39,086
Hey!

938
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:41,380
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!

939
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:45,384
You too now?

940
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:48,053
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

941
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:49,638
You're gonna put yourself
on the line

942
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,140
for this scumbag, Jim?

943
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:53,225
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

944
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,479
Okay, give him the room.

945
01:12:13,078 --> 01:12:14,413
Two minutes.

946
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:27,760
You listen to me.

947
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:31,346
We gotta get you out of here.

948
01:12:32,806 --> 01:12:34,808
That would put
a lot of heat on you.

949
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:36,727
Well, you punched me
in the face.

950
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,230
Take this key.

951
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:42,775
Through that door.

952
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:45,652
Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.

953
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:48,447
Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

954
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:50,824
Hey, hey, hey,
what's going on?

955
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:56,705
Who's the mustache
with the broken nose?

956
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,628
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

957
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,463
He's one of the guys
I got into it with

958
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:05,839
at the Iceberg Lounge.

959
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:07,633
What are you saying?

960
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:09,384
Kenzie moonlights
for the Penguin?

961
01:13:12,012 --> 01:13:14,056
Or he moonlights as a cop.

962
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:19,978
-Jesus Christ!
-Go!

963
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:21,563
Somebody stop him!

964
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:01,395
-There he is!
-Freeze!

965
01:14:47,482 --> 01:14:49,651
Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.

966
01:14:50,194 --> 01:14:51,278
I did.

967
01:14:51,361 --> 01:14:53,071
Bock put out an APB on you.

968
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:54,740
You really think
he's in on this?

969
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,950
I don't trust any of 'em.
Do you?

970
01:14:57,034 --> 01:14:58,577
I only trust you.

971
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:00,454
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

972
01:15:00,537 --> 01:15:02,748
Colson said,
"Cops protect the rat."

973
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:04,583
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

974
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:05,959
You think Penguin's the rat?

975
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:07,461
His club caters to the mob.

976
01:15:07,544 --> 01:15:09,004
Maroni
practically lived there.

977
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:11,048
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

978
01:15:11,131 --> 01:15:12,382
DA was a regular, too.

979
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:14,218
Maybe Penguin
got himself into a jam

980
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:17,012
and working a deal
was his only way out.

981
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:19,514
-The Rata Alada.
-The what?

982
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:21,016
Riddler's latest.

983
01:15:21,099 --> 01:15:22,601
The cipher in the maze.

984
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:25,354
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.

985
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:28,565
A penguin's got wings, too.

986
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:32,319
Time for me to have
another conversation with him.

987
01:15:32,402 --> 01:15:34,196
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

988
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:35,447
It's all connected.

989
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:37,449
Like it or not,
it's his game now.

990
01:15:37,532 --> 01:15:40,744
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.

991
01:15:43,163 --> 01:15:44,331
Kenzie and the twins,

992
01:15:44,414 --> 01:15:45,582
coming your way.

993
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:47,626
There's Penguin.

994
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:49,503
I wonder
what's in the bags.

995
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:52,381
You want to move in?

996
01:15:54,174 --> 01:15:55,592
Let's follow.

997
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:15,737
They stopped
at Waterfront Street.

998
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:17,698
The recycling plant.

999
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:20,200
I'm here.

1000
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:22,119
-How you doing?
-Yeah, good. How are you?

1001
01:16:22,202 --> 01:16:23,328
Good, good.

1002
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:25,831
Let's get in
out of this deluge.

1003
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:46,518
It's a drug lab. Drops.

1004
01:16:46,601 --> 01:16:47,811
This is a buy.

1005
01:16:47,894 --> 01:16:49,396
Looks like
they got Maroni's operation

1006
01:16:49,479 --> 01:16:50,897
up and running again.

1007
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:52,065
Or they never
shut it down at all.

1008
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:53,692
What are you saying?

1009
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:56,945
The biggest drug bust
in GCPD history was a fraud?

1010
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:23,221
This just got complicated.

1011
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:24,514
What do you mean?

1012
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,147
Hey! What happened?

1013
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:33,482
You all right?

1014
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:45,744
Dangerous crowd
you're stealing from.

1015
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:48,246
Jesus.

1016
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,582
Is this how
you get your kicks, hon?

1017
01:17:50,665 --> 01:17:52,000
Sneaking up on girls
in the dark?

1018
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:54,586
Is that why
you work in the club?

1019
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:55,921
It was all just a score?

1020
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:57,589
You know, I would love
to sit and go over

1021
01:17:57,672 --> 01:17:59,591
every gory detail
with you, bat boy,

1022
01:17:59,674 --> 01:18:02,761
but, uh, those assholes
are coming back.

1023
01:18:14,064 --> 01:18:16,066
-Jesus!

1024
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:44,886
Hey, Vengeance!

1025
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:49,766
You think you can come
after my money, huh?

1026
01:19:30,515 --> 01:19:32,142
Kenzie! Get the money!

1027
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:38,857
Hey! What the...

1028
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:30,534
Whoa!

1029
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:35,580
Come on! Come on!

1030
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:40,752
This guy's crazy!

1031
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:43,547
Come on! Hey!

1032
01:21:32,887 --> 01:21:33,972
Move!

1033
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,580
Get out of the way!

1034
01:22:51,716 --> 01:22:52,801
Come on!

1035
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:02,644
Get out of the way!

1036
01:23:38,888 --> 01:23:41,891
I got you!

1037
01:23:43,101 --> 01:23:44,394
I got you!

1038
01:23:44,477 --> 01:23:46,813
Take that,
you friggin' psycho!

1039
01:23:46,896 --> 01:23:48,398
I got you!

1040
01:25:04,974 --> 01:25:07,936
What the hell is this?
Good cop, batshit cop?

1041
01:25:08,019 --> 01:25:10,647
-Who's the Riddler?
-Riddler? How should I know?

1042
01:25:10,730 --> 01:25:12,106
Let's make it
easy for you, Oz.

1043
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:13,566
Cops caught you
doing something.

1044
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:15,235
They were gonna
shut you down, put you away.

1045
01:25:15,318 --> 01:25:17,195
So you gave up a bigger fish
to save your ass.

1046
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:19,405
You ratted out
Salvatore Maroni.

1047
01:25:19,489 --> 01:25:20,782
His drops operation.

1048
01:25:20,865 --> 01:25:22,200
But the cops,
the city officials,

1049
01:25:22,283 --> 01:25:23,243
the mayor, the DA,

1050
01:25:23,326 --> 01:25:24,536
they got greedy, right?

1051
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:26,830
Wasn't enough,
a big career-making bust.

1052
01:25:26,913 --> 01:25:28,665
They wanted to take over
the drops business too,

1053
01:25:28,748 --> 01:25:31,125
but they needed a minor league
mope like you to run it.

1054
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:33,461
You don't just work
for Carmine Falcone.

1055
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:34,629
You work for them, too.

1056
01:25:34,712 --> 01:25:35,880
What are you, crazy?

1057
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:36,923
That why
you killed the girl?

1058
01:25:37,006 --> 01:25:38,216
I didn't kill no girl!

1059
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:39,884
We know she worked for you
at the 44 Below.

1060
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,177
But she got too close, right?

1061
01:25:41,261 --> 01:25:42,554
Found out from Mitchell

1062
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:43,930
that you were the rat,
so you killed her.

1063
01:25:44,013 --> 01:25:45,390
But somehow
Riddler found out, too.

1064
01:25:45,473 --> 01:25:47,433
He knows so much about you.

1065
01:25:47,517 --> 01:25:50,061
-You must know about him.
-Who is he?

1066
01:25:50,144 --> 01:25:52,730
Boy, you guys are a hell
of a duet here.

1067
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:54,399
Why don't you start
harmonizing?

1068
01:25:54,482 --> 01:25:57,068
There's only one problem with
your little scenario, okay?

1069
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:58,570
I ain't no rat!

1070
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:00,405
You got any idea what
Carmine Falcone would do to me

1071
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:01,656
if he heard this kind of talk?

1072
01:26:01,739 --> 01:26:03,700
Oh, you don't wanna talk
about rats, huh?

1073
01:26:03,783 --> 01:26:04,993
Maybe we can talk about

1074
01:26:05,076 --> 01:26:06,327
what they did
to my partner's face.

1075
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:07,912
Holy God, what are you
showing me here?

1076
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:09,747
-This was around his head!
-Come on!

1077
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:11,833
Open your eyes!

1078
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:17,422
Are you El Rata Alada?

1079
01:26:17,505 --> 01:26:18,756
El Rata Alada?

1080
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,091
Yeah,
a "rat with wings."

1081
01:26:20,174 --> 01:26:21,593
A stool pigeon.
That's not you?

1082
01:26:21,676 --> 01:26:23,136
The symbols in the maze,
right here.

1083
01:26:23,219 --> 01:26:25,847
It says you are El Rata Alada.

1084
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:27,223
"You are El Rata"?
It says that?

1085
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:28,641
Why, you got something
to tell us?

1086
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:29,976
Yeah!

1087
01:26:30,059 --> 01:26:31,603
It's, like, the worst Spanish
I ever heard.

1088
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:33,938
-What?
-It's "La."

1089
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:35,607
"La" rata.

1090
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:37,775
What, is this Riddler stupid
or something?

1091
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:40,069
Jesus! Look at you two.

1092
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:42,655
World's greatest detectives!

1093
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:44,032
Am I the only here
knows the difference

1094
01:26:44,115 --> 01:26:45,450
between "el" and "la"?

1095
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:47,827
Jesus!
No habla espanol, fellas?

1096
01:26:47,911 --> 01:26:50,038
Do me a favor, shithead,
shut up!

1097
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:52,582
You think he made a mistake?

1098
01:26:52,665 --> 01:26:53,750
He doesn't made mistakes.

1099
01:26:53,833 --> 01:26:55,084
A rat with wings?

1100
01:26:55,168 --> 01:26:56,628
You know what
that sounds like to me?

1101
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:59,797
A friggin' bat! Huh?
You ever think of that?

1102
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:01,966
"You are El Rata."

1103
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:09,182
"You"...

1104
01:27:09,265 --> 01:27:10,308
"are"...

1105
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:11,434
"El."

1106
01:27:19,859 --> 01:27:22,403
Maybe it was a mistake.
Maybe he isn't as smart as...

1107
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:23,696
-Wait.

1108
01:27:27,158 --> 01:27:29,243
Is that him?

1109
01:27:29,327 --> 01:27:31,621
-Holy shit.

1110
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:52,684
What the hell does that mean?
Is he or isn't he?

1111
01:28:21,879 --> 01:28:25,550
"I grew up from a seed,
tough as a weed...

1112
01:28:25,633 --> 01:28:28,428
But in a mansion,
in a slum...

1113
01:28:28,511 --> 01:28:31,305
I'll never know
where I come from.

1114
01:28:31,389 --> 01:28:32,807
Do you know what I am?"

1115
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:33,891
Any idea?

1116
01:28:34,434 --> 01:28:35,435
Yeah.

1117
01:28:36,811 --> 01:28:38,104
It's an orphan.

1118
01:28:46,946 --> 01:28:48,740
A mansion in a slum.

1119
01:28:50,199 --> 01:28:51,659
He's talking about
the old orphanage.

1120
01:28:51,743 --> 01:28:52,869
The one that burned down?

1121
01:28:52,952 --> 01:28:55,288
It was part of
the Wayne estate.

1122
01:28:55,371 --> 01:28:57,582
They donated it
after they built the tower.

1123
01:28:57,665 --> 01:28:58,750
Let's go.

1124
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:03,504
You guys realize
I'm still here, right?

1125
01:29:04,547 --> 01:29:05,923
You gonna untie me?

1126
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:07,425
How the hell am I supposed
to get out of here?

1127
01:29:11,345 --> 01:29:12,346
Hey!

1128
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:16,267
You goddamn sons of bitches!

1129
01:29:30,114 --> 01:29:32,492
-No guns.

1130
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:35,995
Yeah, man.
That's your thing.

1131
01:29:57,058 --> 01:29:58,267
What's that?

1132
01:30:08,903 --> 01:30:10,863
Hey! Hey!

1133
01:30:17,286 --> 01:30:19,122
Dropheads.

1134
01:30:25,878 --> 01:30:27,588
What the hell is that?

1135
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:41,727
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1136
01:30:41,811 --> 01:30:43,062
Wasn't that beautiful?

1137
01:30:45,648 --> 01:30:48,067
Thank you all.
Thank you, uh...

1138
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:49,861
Thank you for coming today.

1139
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:53,197
I believe in Gotham.

1140
01:30:54,365 --> 01:30:57,201
I believe in its promise.

1141
01:30:57,285 --> 01:31:01,372
But too many have been
left behind for too long,

1142
01:31:01,455 --> 01:31:03,082
and that's why I'm here today.

1143
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:05,960
To announce, not only
my candidacy for mayor,

1144
01:31:06,043 --> 01:31:10,047
but also the creation
of the Gotham Renewal Fund.

1145
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:11,799
Win or lose,

1146
01:31:11,883 --> 01:31:15,011
the Wayne Foundation pledges
a one billion dollar donation

1147
01:31:15,094 --> 01:31:18,431
to start a charitable
endowment for public works.

1148
01:31:18,514 --> 01:31:20,224
I want to bypass
political gridlock,

1149
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:22,560
and get money
to people and projects

1150
01:31:22,643 --> 01:31:24,729
who need it now,

1151
01:31:24,812 --> 01:31:26,355
like these children behind me.

1152
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:28,024
"Sins of the father."

1153
01:31:28,107 --> 01:31:31,861
Renewal is about growth.
It is about planting seeds

1154
01:31:31,944 --> 01:31:34,906
and renewing
Gotham's promise.

1155
01:31:38,701 --> 01:31:41,078
Shall be visited upon the son.

1156
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:46,167
Jesus. His next victim
is Bruce Wayne.

1157
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:52,089
Hey!

1158
01:32:51,691 --> 01:32:52,984
-Hello?
-Dory!

1159
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:54,277
I need to speak to Alfred!

1160
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:56,237
-Oh, Mr. Wayne...
-Listen to me!

1161
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,656
Something terrible
is gonna happen!

1162
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:01,993
I'm afraid
it already has, sir.

1163
01:33:12,336 --> 01:33:14,255
About an hour ago.

1164
01:33:15,381 --> 01:33:17,091
I'm so sorry.

1165
01:33:18,592 --> 01:33:20,469
I've been trying to reach you.

1166
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:25,224
The package
was intended for you.

1167
01:33:25,308 --> 01:33:27,685
It was a C-4 explosive
sent in a mailer.

1168
01:33:27,768 --> 01:33:29,228
We found this too.

1169
01:33:51,834 --> 01:33:53,377
We've sedated him.

1170
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:55,838
We just have to hope
he stabilizes.

1171
01:33:55,921 --> 01:33:59,133
You should go home, Mr. Wayne.
Get some sleep.

1172
01:33:59,216 --> 01:34:01,093
Is there anyone else
to notify?

1173
01:34:02,386 --> 01:34:03,763
Next of kin?

1174
01:34:08,976 --> 01:34:10,061
No.

1175
01:34:11,145 --> 01:34:12,688
It's just me.

1176
01:35:55,791 --> 01:35:57,084
Selina?

1177
01:36:03,674 --> 01:36:04,675
Can you see me?

1178
01:36:07,803 --> 01:36:10,431
-Yeah, I can see you.
-I need to talk to you.

1179
01:36:11,265 --> 01:36:12,433
Where can we go?

1180
01:36:30,701 --> 01:36:32,786
Cat burglar
pulling another score?

1181
01:36:33,704 --> 01:36:34,705
What?

1182
01:36:34,788 --> 01:36:36,081
Wasn't sure I'd see you again.

1183
01:36:36,165 --> 01:36:37,291
Yeah, well,
things were getting

1184
01:36:37,374 --> 01:36:39,543
a little hot for me, so...

1185
01:36:39,627 --> 01:36:41,295
How could they do that to her?

1186
01:36:41,378 --> 01:36:43,422
That piece of shit cop,
Kenzie.

1187
01:36:43,506 --> 01:36:45,299
Her body was in his car.

1188
01:36:45,382 --> 01:36:47,510
I'm gonna find him
and I'm gonna make him pay.

1189
01:36:47,593 --> 01:36:49,303
-You gonna help me?
-Help you?

1190
01:36:49,386 --> 01:36:51,305
Yeah. I thought
you were "Vengeance."

1191
01:36:51,388 --> 01:36:53,057
Your friend got involved
with the wrong people.

1192
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:54,642
She didn't know any better.

1193
01:36:54,725 --> 01:36:56,101
Maybe you should have
explained it to her.

1194
01:36:56,185 --> 01:36:57,853
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

1195
01:36:57,937 --> 01:36:59,396
It means your choices
have consequences.

1196
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:01,815
Jesus Christ. "Choices"?

1197
01:37:01,899 --> 01:37:03,108
You know,
whoever the hell you are,

1198
01:37:03,192 --> 01:37:04,735
you obviously grew up rich.

1199
01:37:04,818 --> 01:37:06,737
-Was it worth it?
-What?

1200
01:37:06,820 --> 01:37:10,241
Compromising yourself
for money?

1201
01:37:10,324 --> 01:37:14,078
What did you have to do
to set up that score?

1202
01:37:14,161 --> 01:37:17,873
How close did you have to get
to Penguin? To Falcone?

1203
01:37:17,957 --> 01:37:19,416
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

1204
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:21,627
-Falcone owes me that money.
-He owes you?

1205
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:23,337
-Yeah, and a lot more.
-Oh, really? Why's that?

1206
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:24,588
You know what?
I can't even talk to you.

1207
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:26,048
No! I want to know

1208
01:37:26,131 --> 01:37:27,508
why a guy like Falcone
would owe you anything.

1209
01:37:27,591 --> 01:37:29,969
Because he's my father!

1210
01:37:39,019 --> 01:37:41,897
My mother worked
at the 44 Below.

1211
01:37:43,357 --> 01:37:44,692
Just like Anni.

1212
01:37:46,652 --> 01:37:49,405
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.

1213
01:37:51,448 --> 01:37:52,825
To the club?

1214
01:37:53,742 --> 01:37:54,743
Yeah.

1215
01:37:57,246 --> 01:38:00,624
I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.

1216
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:03,127
Used to see him there.

1217
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:05,296
He scared the shit out of me.

1218
01:38:07,172 --> 01:38:08,382
And I could never understand

1219
01:38:08,465 --> 01:38:10,926
why he looked at me
the way he did.

1220
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:14,972
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.

1221
01:38:18,225 --> 01:38:20,769
When I was seven,
my mother was murdered.

1222
01:38:21,395 --> 01:38:23,188
Strangled.

1223
01:38:23,272 --> 01:38:24,523
Never found out who.

1224
01:38:24,607 --> 01:38:26,817
Probably some creep
from the club.

1225
01:38:28,485 --> 01:38:30,613
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,

1226
01:38:30,696 --> 01:38:33,032
and he didn't say a thing.

1227
01:38:34,783 --> 01:38:36,660
Couldn't even look at me.

1228
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:42,166
He owes me that money.

1229
01:38:43,959 --> 01:38:45,377
I'm sorry.

1230
01:38:46,462 --> 01:38:47,671
For what I said.

1231
01:38:48,964 --> 01:38:50,466
Ah, it's all right.

1232
01:38:53,802 --> 01:38:56,055
You assume the worst
in people.

1233
01:38:56,930 --> 01:38:58,349
Which, well...

1234
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:02,728
maybe we're not
so different after all.

1235
01:39:07,942 --> 01:39:09,777
Who are you under there?

1236
01:39:15,783 --> 01:39:17,743
What are you hiding?

1237
01:39:20,079 --> 01:39:21,955
Are you just...

1238
01:39:23,457 --> 01:39:25,250
hideously scarred?

1239
01:39:27,378 --> 01:39:28,379
Yeah.

1240
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:37,012
Listen to me.

1241
01:39:38,514 --> 01:39:42,351
If we don't stand up
for Annika, no one will.

1242
01:39:42,434 --> 01:39:44,561
All anyone cares about
in this place

1243
01:39:44,645 --> 01:39:47,731
are these white,
privileged assholes.

1244
01:39:47,815 --> 01:39:50,901
The mayor,
the commissioner, the DA.

1245
01:39:50,984 --> 01:39:52,236
Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.

1246
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:53,654
I mean, as far
as I'm concerned,

1247
01:39:53,737 --> 01:39:55,656
that psycho's right
to go after these creeps.

1248
01:39:55,739 --> 01:39:57,074
I think you'd be on his side.

1249
01:39:57,157 --> 01:39:58,742
What do you mean,
"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?

1250
01:39:58,826 --> 01:40:00,661
What, do you live in a cave?

1251
01:40:00,744 --> 01:40:03,831
The Riddler's latest.
It's all about the Waynes.

1252
01:40:03,914 --> 01:40:08,043
Listen, if I can find
that dickbag Kenzie,

1253
01:40:08,127 --> 01:40:09,294
will you help me?

1254
01:40:10,504 --> 01:40:11,839
Please.

1255
01:40:14,508 --> 01:40:16,510
Come on, Vengeance.

1256
01:40:18,762 --> 01:40:21,098
Just don't make any moves
without me, understand?

1257
01:40:21,181 --> 01:40:22,850
It's a little more dangerous
than you know...

1258
01:40:32,776 --> 01:40:34,361
I told you, baby.

1259
01:40:36,029 --> 01:40:38,699
I can take care of myself.

1260
01:40:49,293 --> 01:40:52,796
I'm Thomas Wayne,
and I approve this message.

1261
01:41:00,596 --> 01:41:01,972
From a very young age,

1262
01:41:02,055 --> 01:41:04,183
my family, Martha's family,
the Arkhams,

1263
01:41:04,266 --> 01:41:05,976
{\an8}instilled in both of us

1264
01:41:06,059 --> 01:41:08,896
{\an8}that giving back
is not just an obligation,

1265
01:41:08,979 --> 01:41:10,981
{\an8}it's a passion.

1266
01:41:11,064 --> 01:41:14,443
{\an8}That is our family's legacy.

1267
01:41:14,526 --> 01:41:16,987
{\an8}
The Waynes and the Arkhams.

1268
01:41:17,070 --> 01:41:19,490
{\an8}Gotham's founding families.

1269
01:41:19,573 --> 01:41:23,869
{\an8}But what is their real legacy?

1270
01:41:23,952 --> 01:41:26,914
{\an8}Twenty years ago,
one reporter set out

1271
01:41:26,997 --> 01:41:28,665
{\an8}to uncover the dark truth.

1272
01:41:28,749 --> 01:41:33,045
{\an8}He found
shocking family secrets.

1273
01:41:33,128 --> 01:41:35,088
{\an8}How, when Martha
was just a child,

1274
01:41:35,172 --> 01:41:37,341
{\an8}her mother
brutally murdered her father,

1275
01:41:37,424 --> 01:41:38,884
{\an8}then committed suicide...

1276
01:41:38,967 --> 01:41:40,511
{\an8}-
-...and how the Arkhams

1277
01:41:40,594 --> 01:41:44,723
{\an8}used their power and money
to cover it up.

1278
01:41:44,807 --> 01:41:46,683
{\an8}How Martha herself

1279
01:41:46,767 --> 01:41:49,520
{\an8}was in and out of institutions
for years,

1280
01:41:49,603 --> 01:41:52,523
and they didn't want
anyone to know.

1281
01:41:52,606 --> 01:41:55,067
{\an8}Thomas Wayne tried to force
this crusading reporter

1282
01:41:55,150 --> 01:41:59,571
{\an8}into a hush-money agreement
to save his mayoral campaign.

1283
01:41:59,655 --> 01:42:01,865
{\an8}But when
the reporter refused,

1284
01:42:01,949 --> 01:42:04,701
{\an8}Wayne turned
to longtime secret associate

1285
01:42:04,785 --> 01:42:06,203
{\an8}Carmine Falcone,

1286
01:42:06,286 --> 01:42:08,747
{\an8}
and had him murdered!

1287
01:42:08,831 --> 01:42:12,501
-The Waynes and the Arkhams,

1288
01:42:12,584 --> 01:42:18,215
{\an8}Gotham's legacy
of lies and murder.

1289
01:42:18,298 --> 01:42:20,717
I hope
you're listening, Bruce Wayne.

1290
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:23,387
This is your legacy too.

1291
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:26,849
And Gotham needs you to answer

1292
01:42:26,932 --> 01:42:29,935
for the sins of your father.

1293
01:42:31,478 --> 01:42:33,272
Goodbye.

1294
01:42:38,819 --> 01:42:39,945
Do you know who I am?

1295
01:42:41,488 --> 01:42:42,573
You're Bruce Wayne.

1296
01:42:42,656 --> 01:42:44,658
I wanna see Carmine Falcone.

1297
01:42:55,419 --> 01:42:56,420
See?

1298
01:43:08,056 --> 01:43:10,893
Who is this guy
who invented the ball, right?

1299
01:43:10,976 --> 01:43:13,353
Must have made a fortune.

1300
01:43:13,437 --> 01:43:16,607
If you think about it,
the concept of it, right?

1301
01:43:16,690 --> 01:43:19,276
Briscoe, do you know
how much this sweater cost?

1302
01:43:19,359 --> 01:43:20,402
No, boss.

1303
01:43:20,485 --> 01:43:23,238
$1,183.

1304
01:43:23,322 --> 01:43:25,324
You know
why communism failed, right?

1305
01:43:25,407 --> 01:43:26,491
No, boss.

1306
01:43:28,368 --> 01:43:29,620
Austerity.

1307
01:43:31,788 --> 01:43:33,290
All right. All right.

1308
01:43:33,373 --> 01:43:36,001
Look at that. Perfect.

1309
01:43:36,084 --> 01:43:38,045
It's never gonna be
that good again.

1310
01:43:40,213 --> 01:43:42,674
Hey, Johnny Slick.

1311
01:43:42,758 --> 01:43:43,967
What are you doing here?

1312
01:43:45,761 --> 01:43:47,721
Give us a moment here, fellas.

1313
01:43:48,555 --> 01:43:49,681
Come on.

1314
01:43:51,558 --> 01:43:52,809
See ya, champ.

1315
01:43:53,727 --> 01:43:55,062
Come on, sweetheart.

1316
01:43:56,980 --> 01:43:58,023
Have a seat.

1317
01:43:59,942 --> 01:44:02,778
I thought
I might hear from you.

1318
01:44:02,861 --> 01:44:06,156
This, uh, Riddler
son of a bitch is really

1319
01:44:07,616 --> 01:44:09,409
stirring things up, huh?

1320
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:11,286
-Is it true?
-What?

1321
01:44:12,496 --> 01:44:14,206
That reporter business?

1322
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:16,875
What do you want
to know here, kid?

1323
01:44:16,959 --> 01:44:19,628
Did you kill him?
For my father?

1324
01:44:19,711 --> 01:44:23,298
Look, your father
was in trouble.

1325
01:44:23,382 --> 01:44:25,217
This reporter had some dirt.

1326
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:27,844
Some very

1327
01:44:27,928 --> 01:44:30,681
personal stuff
about your mother,

1328
01:44:30,764 --> 01:44:32,015
her family history.

1329
01:44:32,099 --> 01:44:33,600
You know, everybody's got
their dirty laundry,

1330
01:44:33,684 --> 01:44:34,977
that's just how it is.

1331
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:36,144
But he didn't want
none of it coming out,

1332
01:44:36,228 --> 01:44:38,397
not right before the election.

1333
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:40,691
And your father
tried to pay the guy off,

1334
01:44:40,774 --> 01:44:42,651
but he wasn't going for it.

1335
01:44:42,734 --> 01:44:44,319
So...

1336
01:44:44,403 --> 01:44:45,737
he came to me.

1337
01:44:45,821 --> 01:44:48,365
Well, I never seen him
like that.

1338
01:44:49,116 --> 01:44:51,535
He said, "Carmine,

1339
01:44:51,618 --> 01:44:56,540
"I want you to put
the fear of God in this guy."

1340
01:44:58,834 --> 01:45:01,878
And when fear isn't enough...

1341
01:45:02,587 --> 01:45:04,047
Oof. Hmm.

1342
01:45:05,507 --> 01:45:09,011
Your father wanted me
to handle it, so I did.

1343
01:45:09,970 --> 01:45:11,847
I handled it.

1344
01:45:13,515 --> 01:45:14,808
I know.

1345
01:45:14,891 --> 01:45:17,310
You thought your father
was a Boy Scout.

1346
01:45:18,478 --> 01:45:20,272
But you'd be surprised

1347
01:45:20,355 --> 01:45:22,691
what even a good man like him

1348
01:45:22,774 --> 01:45:25,527
is capable of
in the right situation.

1349
01:45:27,738 --> 01:45:29,406
Do me a favor.

1350
01:45:29,489 --> 01:45:31,616
Don't lose any sleep over it.

1351
01:45:32,325 --> 01:45:33,910
This reporter

1352
01:45:34,703 --> 01:45:36,246
was a lowlife.

1353
01:45:36,329 --> 01:45:37,873
He was on Maroni's payroll.

1354
01:45:39,416 --> 01:45:41,585
-Maroni?
-Oh, yeah.

1355
01:45:41,668 --> 01:45:45,756
He could never stand
your father and I had history.

1356
01:45:45,839 --> 01:45:48,091
And... And after what happened
with that reporter,

1357
01:45:48,175 --> 01:45:49,843
Maroni was worried

1358
01:45:49,926 --> 01:45:52,429
that your father
would be in my pocket

1359
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:54,639
forever.

1360
01:45:54,723 --> 01:45:56,767
He would have done anything

1361
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:59,102
to keep him
from becoming mayor.

1362
01:45:59,186 --> 01:46:00,562
You understand?

1363
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:03,023
Are you saying

1364
01:46:03,106 --> 01:46:06,276
Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?

1365
01:46:06,359 --> 01:46:08,445
Do I know it for a fact?

1366
01:46:10,697 --> 01:46:12,949
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.

1367
01:46:14,201 --> 01:46:16,495
This is what you wanted, huh?

1368
01:46:16,578 --> 01:46:19,331
This little conversation here?

1369
01:46:21,416 --> 01:46:23,710
It's been
a long time coming, huh?

1370
01:46:26,213 --> 01:46:28,465
I mean,
you ain't a kid no more.

1371
01:47:38,118 --> 01:47:39,452
You lied to me...

1372
01:47:42,247 --> 01:47:43,915
my whole life.

1373
01:47:48,962 --> 01:47:51,131
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

1374
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:57,262
He told me what he did
for my father.

1375
01:48:01,308 --> 01:48:02,893
About Salvatore Maroni.

1376
01:48:04,644 --> 01:48:07,397
He told you
Salvatore Maroni...

1377
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:09,316
Had my father killed.

1378
01:48:11,651 --> 01:48:13,987
Why didn't you tell me
all this?

1379
01:48:16,531 --> 01:48:21,661
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,

1380
01:48:21,745 --> 01:48:24,080
believing that he was
a good man.

1381
01:48:24,164 --> 01:48:26,374
He was a good man.

1382
01:48:26,458 --> 01:48:28,084
You listen to me.

1383
01:48:28,168 --> 01:48:31,713
Your father was a good man.

1384
01:48:35,425 --> 01:48:37,427
-He made a mistake.
-A "mistake."

1385
01:48:37,510 --> 01:48:39,512
He had a man killed.

1386
01:48:39,596 --> 01:48:41,681
Why?

1387
01:48:41,765 --> 01:48:45,101
To protect his family image?

1388
01:48:46,102 --> 01:48:47,270
His political aspirations?

1389
01:48:47,354 --> 01:48:48,813
It wasn't to protect
the family image,

1390
01:48:48,897 --> 01:48:51,066
and he didn't have
anyone killed.

1391
01:48:53,526 --> 01:48:55,779
He was protecting your mother.

1392
01:48:55,862 --> 01:48:59,616
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

1393
01:48:59,699 --> 01:49:01,910
He cared about her

1394
01:49:01,993 --> 01:49:03,370
and you,

1395
01:49:03,453 --> 01:49:06,039
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

1396
01:49:06,122 --> 01:49:10,460
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

1397
01:49:10,543 --> 01:49:12,170
Your father should have known

1398
01:49:12,254 --> 01:49:13,880
that Falcone would do anything

1399
01:49:13,964 --> 01:49:17,133
to finally have something
on him that he could use.

1400
01:49:17,217 --> 01:49:19,052
That's who Falcone is.

1401
01:49:21,221 --> 01:49:23,556
And that was
your father's mistake.

1402
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:25,642
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

1403
01:49:25,725 --> 01:49:29,145
your father was distraught.

1404
01:49:29,229 --> 01:49:32,482
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

1405
01:49:32,565 --> 01:49:34,901
that he would confess
everything.

1406
01:49:36,361 --> 01:49:38,321
And that night,

1407
01:49:38,405 --> 01:49:41,157
your father and your mother

1408
01:49:41,241 --> 01:49:42,409
were killed.

1409
01:49:47,831 --> 01:49:49,582
It was Falcone?

1410
01:49:55,588 --> 01:49:57,757
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1411
01:50:02,304 --> 01:50:05,932
Or maybe it was some
random thug on the street

1412
01:50:06,016 --> 01:50:07,475
who needed money, got scared,

1413
01:50:07,559 --> 01:50:08,852
and pulled the trigger
too fast.

1414
01:50:08,935 --> 01:50:12,022
If you don't think
I've spent every day

1415
01:50:12,105 --> 01:50:14,190
searching for that answer...

1416
01:50:15,734 --> 01:50:20,280
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

1417
01:50:20,363 --> 01:50:22,324
I know you always
blamed yourself.

1418
01:50:22,407 --> 01:50:24,909
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1419
01:50:26,953 --> 01:50:29,331
I could see the fear
in your eyes,

1420
01:50:30,623 --> 01:50:33,043
but I didn't know how to help.

1421
01:50:33,126 --> 01:50:36,796
I could teach you
how to fight,

1422
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,716
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

1423
01:50:39,799 --> 01:50:41,676
You needed a father.

1424
01:50:43,553 --> 01:50:46,056
And all you had was me.

1425
01:50:48,391 --> 01:50:49,642
I'm sorry.

1426
01:50:51,311 --> 01:50:53,313
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1427
01:51:00,111 --> 01:51:01,196
God.

1428
01:51:04,032 --> 01:51:08,578
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

1429
01:51:11,164 --> 01:51:13,416
I thought
I'd mastered all that.

1430
01:51:19,839 --> 01:51:21,132
I mean,

1431
01:51:22,258 --> 01:51:24,469
I'm not afraid to die.

1432
01:51:26,096 --> 01:51:28,598
I realize now
there's something

1433
01:51:29,682 --> 01:51:31,601
I haven't got past.

1434
01:51:32,477 --> 01:51:34,270
This fear...

1435
01:51:36,523 --> 01:51:39,692
of ever going through
any of that again.

1436
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:46,116
Of losing somebody
I care about.

1437
01:52:36,749 --> 01:52:37,792
Hey.

1438
01:52:37,876 --> 01:52:40,503
I saw the signal.
That's not you?

1439
01:52:40,587 --> 01:52:42,464
I thought it was you.

1440
01:52:55,268 --> 01:52:56,853
-I found him!
-I see that.

1441
01:52:56,936 --> 01:52:58,438
He had my shit and my phone.

1442
01:52:58,521 --> 01:53:00,064
She left a message
the night they took her.

1443
01:53:00,148 --> 01:53:02,525
-She called me...
-Gordon! Help me out, man!

1444
01:53:02,609 --> 01:53:04,152
She got my gun!

1445
01:53:05,487 --> 01:53:08,281
-Shut up!
-Put the gun down.

1446
01:53:08,364 --> 01:53:11,117
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

1447
01:53:15,455 --> 01:53:17,749
-Here. Listen.

1448
01:53:19,709 --> 01:53:21,544
Hey! Get back here!

1449
01:53:21,628 --> 01:53:22,879
-Where you going?

1450
01:53:22,962 --> 01:53:24,464
Come back here!

1451
01:53:24,547 --> 01:53:25,798
Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?

1452
01:53:25,882 --> 01:53:27,217
You're scaring her.

1453
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:28,885
I'm...
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.

1454
01:53:28,968 --> 01:53:30,220
Please, please, please.

1455
01:53:30,303 --> 01:53:31,721
Please, don't hurt me, please.

1456
01:53:31,804 --> 01:53:34,474
Hey, don't be scared.
Come here.

1457
01:53:36,309 --> 01:53:38,895
Now let me ask you again.

1458
01:53:38,978 --> 01:53:41,564
-What did Mitchell tell you?
-No, nothing. He...

1459
01:53:41,648 --> 01:53:44,609
Don liked to talk.
I know that.

1460
01:53:44,692 --> 01:53:47,862
Especially to pretty girls
like you.

1461
01:53:47,946 --> 01:53:50,573
That's why I made him
take your passport,

1462
01:53:50,657 --> 01:53:53,493
until we could have
this little conversation.

1463
01:53:53,576 --> 01:53:56,287
All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?

1464
01:53:56,371 --> 01:53:58,164
You'll never hear from me
again, nobody will.

1465
01:53:58,248 --> 01:53:59,832
Please, please...

1466
01:53:59,916 --> 01:54:02,585
We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.

1467
01:54:02,669 --> 01:54:06,089
But first, I gotta know...

1468
01:54:06,172 --> 01:54:08,216
-What did he tell you?
-He...

1469
01:54:08,299 --> 01:54:12,345
He just said they all made
a deal with you.

1470
01:54:12,428 --> 01:54:15,765
Oh. Hmm.
He told you about that, huh?

1471
01:54:15,848 --> 01:54:17,100
The deal.

1472
01:54:17,183 --> 01:54:18,685
He said

1473
01:54:18,768 --> 01:54:22,021
you gave some information
on some drops thing,

1474
01:54:22,105 --> 01:54:24,774
and that's how
he became mayor.

1475
01:54:24,857 --> 01:54:27,402
He said you were
a very important man.

1476
01:54:27,485 --> 01:54:28,653
Right.

1477
01:54:29,362 --> 01:54:30,697
Mm-hmm.

1478
01:54:31,614 --> 01:54:33,908
Hmm. Okay.

1479
01:54:41,332 --> 01:54:42,792
-Just take it easy.

1480
01:54:42,875 --> 01:54:44,419
Jesus, he's strangling her.

1481
01:54:44,502 --> 01:54:47,630
Take it easy.

1482
01:54:56,806 --> 01:54:58,141
Rata Alada.

1483
01:55:03,062 --> 01:55:04,856
A falcon has wings, too.

1484
01:55:04,939 --> 01:55:06,858
Falcone is the rat?

1485
01:55:17,744 --> 01:55:21,497
Falcone works for you guys?

1486
01:55:21,581 --> 01:55:24,167
The mayor? The DA?

1487
01:55:27,128 --> 01:55:28,796
No.

1488
01:55:31,299 --> 01:55:32,634
We work for him.

1489
01:55:33,593 --> 01:55:34,886
Everybody does.

1490
01:55:34,969 --> 01:55:36,012
How?

1491
01:55:36,095 --> 01:55:38,264
Through Renewal.

1492
01:55:38,348 --> 01:55:39,641
Renewal is everything.

1493
01:55:39,724 --> 01:55:41,684
-The Renewal Fund?
-Yeah.

1494
01:55:41,768 --> 01:55:42,935
After Thomas Wayne died,

1495
01:55:43,019 --> 01:55:45,355
they all went after it
like vultures.

1496
01:55:45,438 --> 01:55:49,192
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

1497
01:55:49,275 --> 01:55:51,444
It was perfect
for making bribes,

1498
01:55:51,527 --> 01:55:52,737
laundering money.

1499
01:55:52,820 --> 01:55:54,656
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

1500
01:55:54,739 --> 01:55:56,532
Everybody got a piece.

1501
01:55:56,616 --> 01:55:58,534
But Falcone wanted more.

1502
01:56:00,328 --> 01:56:03,706
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

1503
01:56:04,874 --> 01:56:07,377
He'd rat out
his drops operation,

1504
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:10,338
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

1505
01:56:10,421 --> 01:56:12,799
then install them all
as his puppets.

1506
01:56:12,882 --> 01:56:15,593
You think this goddamn
election matters?

1507
01:56:17,136 --> 01:56:19,722
Falcone's the mayor.

1508
01:56:19,806 --> 01:56:22,433
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

1509
01:56:22,517 --> 01:56:24,435
Come on, Vengeance.

1510
01:56:24,519 --> 01:56:26,979
Let's go kill
that son of a bitch.

1511
01:56:27,063 --> 01:56:28,439
This creep too.
Let's finish this.

1512
01:56:28,523 --> 01:56:29,649
-Oh, God!
-No!

1513
01:56:31,192 --> 01:56:32,819
We'll get him.

1514
01:56:32,902 --> 01:56:34,904
-But not that way.
-There is no other way!

1515
01:56:34,987 --> 01:56:38,116
-He owns the city!
-Cross that line,

1516
01:56:38,199 --> 01:56:40,201
you'll become just like him.

1517
01:56:40,284 --> 01:56:41,744
Listen to me.

1518
01:56:41,828 --> 01:56:43,830
Don't throw your life away.

1519
01:56:50,253 --> 01:56:51,713
Don't worry, honey.

1520
01:56:54,716 --> 01:56:56,050
I got nine of 'em.

1521
01:56:56,134 --> 01:56:58,344
-No, don't! Hey, hey!

1522
01:57:10,273 --> 01:57:11,858
She won't
get out of there alive.

1523
01:57:11,941 --> 01:57:14,110
And if she kills Falcone,
we may never find the Riddler.

1524
01:57:14,193 --> 01:57:16,487
-I have to stop her.
-Don't you mean "we"?

1525
01:57:17,739 --> 01:57:19,574
I gotta do this my way.

1526
01:57:19,657 --> 01:57:20,700
And then what?

1527
01:57:21,534 --> 01:57:23,619
We do what Riddler said.

1528
01:57:23,703 --> 01:57:25,413
Bring the rat into the light.

1529
01:58:01,157 --> 01:58:03,242
Can you tell Mr. Falcone
I'd like to come up?

1530
01:58:03,326 --> 01:58:05,328
He ain't seein' nobody
tonight.

1531
01:58:05,411 --> 01:58:06,871
Tell him it's about Annika.

1532
01:58:10,082 --> 01:58:12,084
Hey!

1533
01:58:12,168 --> 01:58:13,628
Look who it is, huh?

1534
01:58:13,711 --> 01:58:16,047
-Sorry to bother you.
-Nah. It's fine, beautiful.

1535
01:58:16,130 --> 01:58:18,299
I was just hoping I could
talk to you for a minute?

1536
01:58:18,382 --> 01:58:19,884
Absolutely.

1537
01:58:21,636 --> 01:58:22,595
Alone?

1538
01:58:39,278 --> 01:58:40,363
Hey!

1539
01:58:50,623 --> 01:58:51,874
I'm just so worried.

1540
01:58:51,958 --> 01:58:53,709
I... I don't know
where she is.

1541
01:58:55,253 --> 01:58:58,714
And I know that
you're a very important man.

1542
01:58:58,798 --> 01:59:01,676
I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

1543
01:59:03,636 --> 01:59:07,431
because she's been gone
so long, I'm beginning to...

1544
01:59:07,515 --> 01:59:10,017
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

1545
01:59:10,101 --> 01:59:12,270
-I'm so sorry.
-I understand. Here.

1546
01:59:12,353 --> 01:59:15,356
No, that's okay,
I have a tissue.

1547
01:59:19,485 --> 01:59:21,237
-Mr. Falcone?
-Vinnie!

1548
01:59:21,320 --> 01:59:23,072
-Didn't I tell you?
-I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.

1549
01:59:23,155 --> 01:59:25,366
I really think you're gonna
want to see this.

1550
01:59:27,326 --> 01:59:28,995
I'm sorry, beautiful.

1551
01:59:29,078 --> 01:59:30,413
I'll be right back.

1552
01:59:45,678 --> 01:59:47,096
Holy shit.

1553
01:59:47,179 --> 01:59:48,806
That recording,
provided to GC-1

1554
01:59:48,890 --> 01:59:51,142
by Lieutenant James Gordon
of the Gotham PD.

1555
01:59:51,225 --> 01:59:52,435
And we should warn you,

1556
01:59:52,518 --> 01:59:54,103
the contents
are extremely graphic,

1557
01:59:54,186 --> 01:59:56,939
and some of you
may find it disturbing.

1558
01:59:57,023 --> 01:59:59,025
He just said

1559
01:59:59,108 --> 02:00:01,027
they all made a deal with you.

1560
02:00:01,110 --> 02:00:02,320
Oh. Hmm.

1561
02:00:02,403 --> 02:00:04,155
He told you about that, huh?

1562
02:00:04,238 --> 02:00:05,740
The deal.

1563
02:00:05,823 --> 02:00:07,283
He said

1564
02:00:07,366 --> 02:00:10,620
you gave some information
on some drops thing,

1565
02:00:10,703 --> 02:00:13,414
and that's how
he became mayor.

1566
02:00:13,497 --> 02:00:16,208
He said you were
a very important man.

1567
02:00:16,292 --> 02:00:17,335
Right.

1568
02:00:18,252 --> 02:00:20,671
Hmm. Okay.

1569
02:00:27,720 --> 02:00:30,431
Revelations
of Mr. Falcone's secret role

1570
02:00:30,514 --> 02:00:31,682
as a mafia informant...

1571
02:00:32,266 --> 02:00:33,517
Hey, Dad.

1572
02:00:34,727 --> 02:00:36,020
What?

1573
02:00:36,103 --> 02:00:38,230
I'm Maria Kyle's kid.

1574
02:00:40,107 --> 02:00:41,609
You remember her?

1575
02:00:43,194 --> 02:00:44,236
Yeah.

1576
02:00:45,738 --> 02:00:46,781
Just...

1577
02:00:48,741 --> 02:00:49,867
Just put down the gun, honey.

1578
02:00:49,951 --> 02:00:51,118
This is for my mother.

1579
02:01:48,259 --> 02:01:49,468
I see him!

1580
02:02:33,345 --> 02:02:35,222
You don't think this hurts me?

1581
02:02:38,934 --> 02:02:42,104
-My own flesh and blood, huh?

1582
02:02:58,412 --> 02:03:00,289
You made me do this.

1583
02:03:01,624 --> 02:03:03,501
Just like your mother.

1584
02:03:09,465 --> 02:03:10,841
He has to pay!

1585
02:03:14,637 --> 02:03:15,805
You don't have to pay
with him.

1586
02:03:19,475 --> 02:03:21,018
You paid enough.

1587
02:03:55,553 --> 02:03:56,762
Jesus.

1588
02:03:56,846 --> 02:03:59,265
Look at you, man.
What do you think this is?

1589
02:03:59,348 --> 02:04:00,558
You think
you're gonna scare me

1590
02:04:00,641 --> 02:04:02,434
with that mask and that cape?

1591
02:04:02,518 --> 02:04:04,728
I'm gonna start crying,
and all of a sudden,

1592
02:04:04,812 --> 02:04:06,480
some big secret's comin' out?

1593
02:04:06,564 --> 02:04:08,232
Let me tell you something.

1594
02:04:08,315 --> 02:04:10,025
Whatever I know,

1595
02:04:10,109 --> 02:04:11,944
whatever I've done,

1596
02:04:12,027 --> 02:04:14,613
it's all going with me

1597
02:04:14,697 --> 02:04:16,448
to my grave.

1598
02:04:26,792 --> 02:04:28,919
What, are you with Zorro
over here?

1599
02:04:30,337 --> 02:04:32,840
Don't you know you boys
in blue work for me?

1600
02:04:40,598 --> 02:04:43,017
I guess
we don't all work for you.

1601
02:04:51,984 --> 02:04:54,195
You have the right
to remain silent.

1602
02:04:54,278 --> 02:04:56,572
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

1603
02:04:56,655 --> 02:04:57,907
in a court of law.

1604
02:04:57,990 --> 02:04:59,408
You have the right
to an attorney.

1605
02:04:59,491 --> 02:05:00,743
If you cannot afford one,

1606
02:05:00,826 --> 02:05:02,411
the City of Gotham
will provide one to you.

1607
02:05:02,494 --> 02:05:04,330
Do you understand
these rights?

1608
02:05:05,706 --> 02:05:07,374
Do you understand?

1609
02:05:09,335 --> 02:05:10,419
Yeah.

1610
02:05:10,502 --> 02:05:12,421
I'll see you when I walk out.

1611
02:05:12,504 --> 02:05:13,923
With these rights in mind,

1612
02:05:14,006 --> 02:05:15,007
is there anything else
you wish to tell...

1613
02:05:15,090 --> 02:05:16,383
Goddamn rat.

1614
02:05:18,344 --> 02:05:19,511
What'd you say?

1615
02:05:19,595 --> 02:05:21,513
Enjoy your night
at Blackgate, Carmine.

1616
02:05:22,556 --> 02:05:23,766
Probably be your last.

1617
02:05:23,849 --> 02:05:27,144
Oh-ho! So you're
a big man now, Oz, huh?

1618
02:05:27,228 --> 02:05:28,312
Maybe I am.

1619
02:05:28,395 --> 02:05:29,939
Really, Oz?

1620
02:05:30,022 --> 02:05:34,443
Because to me, you were always
just a gimp in an empty suit.

1621
02:05:34,526 --> 02:05:35,736
I'll spray paint your ass!

1622
02:05:39,531 --> 02:05:40,991
What are you doing?
It wasn't me!

1623
02:05:41,075 --> 02:05:43,244
I didn't shoot!
I didn't shoot!

1624
02:05:44,495 --> 02:05:45,829
Get your hands off of me!

1625
02:06:05,474 --> 02:06:07,559
"Bring him into the light.

1626
02:06:11,021 --> 02:06:13,065
And you'll find
where I'm at."

1627
02:06:13,148 --> 02:06:14,149
There!

1628
02:06:14,233 --> 02:06:16,151
The shots came from up there!

1629
02:06:17,695 --> 02:06:18,654
It's Riddler.

1630
02:06:20,656 --> 02:06:21,865
Gage, on me.

1631
02:06:21,949 --> 02:06:23,117
Martinez, around back.

1632
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:24,827
Nobody gets in there,
nobody gets out!

1633
02:07:39,234 --> 02:07:40,486
He's gone.

1634
02:07:50,162 --> 02:07:52,081
He's been here
this whole time.

1635
02:07:52,164 --> 02:07:54,375
-Lieutenant. Martinez.
-Yeah?

1636
02:07:54,458 --> 02:07:55,876
Lieutenant,
we got a witness here,

1637
02:07:55,959 --> 02:07:57,378
says she saw someone
coming down

1638
02:07:57,461 --> 02:07:58,879
the fire escape
right after the shot.

1639
02:07:58,962 --> 02:08:00,881
She said he went
into the corner diner.

1640
02:08:00,964 --> 02:08:04,093
The guy's sitting by himself
at the counter, right now.

1641
02:08:19,650 --> 02:08:21,735
Police! Hands up!

1642
02:08:24,571 --> 02:08:26,657
He said put
your goddamn hands up,

1643
02:08:26,740 --> 02:08:28,700
you son of a bitch.

1644
02:08:47,219 --> 02:08:49,304
I just ordered
a slice of pumpkin pie.

1645
02:08:52,182 --> 02:08:53,559
Stay still!

1646
02:08:53,642 --> 02:08:54,643
Now!

1647
02:09:23,130 --> 02:09:24,965
Which one is you?

1648
02:09:25,048 --> 02:09:27,342
You tell me.

1649
02:09:27,426 --> 02:09:28,927
Let's go, pencil-neck.

1650
02:09:31,847 --> 02:09:33,682
Get that son of a bitch
out of here!

1651
02:09:48,280 --> 02:09:49,573
...where even murdered mayor

1652
02:09:49,656 --> 02:09:51,325
Don Mitchell, Jr.'s wife
and son

1653
02:09:51,408 --> 02:09:54,203
have gathered in an
emotional show of city unity.

1654
02:09:54,286 --> 02:09:55,621
Our Dan O'Neil is live

1655
02:09:55,704 --> 02:09:56,788
inside Real's headquarters
right now...

1656
02:09:56,872 --> 02:09:57,915
Hey.

1657
02:10:22,272 --> 02:10:23,899
What are all these diaries?

1658
02:10:23,982 --> 02:10:26,360
They're ledgers.
He's got thousands.

1659
02:10:26,443 --> 02:10:29,988
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.

1660
02:10:30,072 --> 02:10:31,573
Got something back
on one of the IDs.

1661
02:10:31,657 --> 02:10:33,951
Edward Nashton. Works at KTMJ.

1662
02:10:34,034 --> 02:10:35,911
-He's a forensic accountant.
-Accountant?

1663
02:10:35,994 --> 02:10:38,455
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?

1664
02:10:38,539 --> 02:10:40,415
What about chain of evidence?

1665
02:10:41,166 --> 02:10:42,459
You should see this.

1666
02:10:48,340 --> 02:10:49,925
He's wearing gloves.

1667
02:10:51,343 --> 02:10:53,428
"Friday, July 16th.

1668
02:10:53,512 --> 02:10:57,558
My life has been a cruel
riddle I could not solve,

1669
02:10:57,641 --> 02:11:00,644
suffocating my mind,
no escape.

1670
02:11:00,727 --> 02:11:02,312
But then, today, I saw it.

1671
02:11:02,396 --> 02:11:06,525
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.

1672
02:11:07,859 --> 02:11:09,444
'Renewal.'

1673
02:11:09,528 --> 02:11:11,613
The empty promise
they sold to me

1674
02:11:11,697 --> 02:11:14,032
as a child in that orphanage.

1675
02:11:14,116 --> 02:11:17,119
One look inside,
and finally I understood.

1676
02:11:17,202 --> 02:11:20,581
My whole life has been
preparing me for this.

1677
02:11:20,664 --> 02:11:23,125
The moment
when I would learn the truth.

1678
02:11:23,208 --> 02:11:24,918
When I could finally
strike back

1679
02:11:25,002 --> 02:11:27,296
-and expose their lies."

1680
02:11:27,379 --> 02:11:31,091
"If you want people to
understand, really understand,

1681
02:11:31,174 --> 02:11:33,552
you can't just
give them the answers.

1682
02:11:33,635 --> 02:11:34,970
You have to confront them,

1683
02:11:35,053 --> 02:11:37,598
torture them
with the horrifying questions,

1684
02:11:37,681 --> 02:11:39,933
just like they tortured me.

1685
02:11:40,017 --> 02:11:42,811
I know now
what I must become."

1686
02:11:45,731 --> 02:11:47,024
Jesus.

1687
02:11:52,988 --> 02:11:55,490
I don't think that rat
likes you, man.

1688
02:11:55,574 --> 02:11:56,950
This one's not a rat.

1689
02:12:13,717 --> 02:12:14,926
What is that?

1690
02:12:46,375 --> 02:12:47,709
Some kind of pry tool?

1691
02:12:47,793 --> 02:12:49,044
Is it a chisel?

1692
02:12:49,127 --> 02:12:50,587
It's a murder weapon.

1693
02:12:50,671 --> 02:12:52,547
He killed Mitchell with it.

1694
02:12:52,631 --> 02:12:54,383
The edge will match
the floorboard impression

1695
02:12:54,466 --> 02:12:55,634
in the mayor's study.

1696
02:13:04,267 --> 02:13:06,228
"My confession"?

1697
02:13:06,311 --> 02:13:07,562
What's he confessing to?

1698
02:13:07,646 --> 02:13:09,356
He already told us
he killed Mitchell.

1699
02:13:09,439 --> 02:13:10,691
This isn't over.

1700
02:13:10,774 --> 02:13:11,942
Oh, man.

1701
02:13:12,025 --> 02:13:13,527
He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.

1702
02:13:13,610 --> 02:13:16,071
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.

1703
02:13:23,328 --> 02:13:26,081
His final post was last night.

1704
02:13:26,164 --> 02:13:27,541
Some video.

1705
02:13:27,624 --> 02:13:29,376
Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.

1706
02:13:29,459 --> 02:13:30,836
Can you get in?

1707
02:13:30,919 --> 02:13:32,546
Copying his drive now.

1708
02:13:32,629 --> 02:13:36,007
Take some time,
but we'll get in.

1709
02:13:47,144 --> 02:13:49,855
-Show me the post.
-It's right here.

1710
02:13:51,565 --> 02:13:53,942
"The Truth Unmasked."

1711
02:13:54,025 --> 02:13:55,694
I think I'm his last target.

1712
02:13:58,280 --> 02:13:59,531
You?

1713
02:13:59,614 --> 02:14:01,783
Maybe this is all
coming to an end.

1714
02:14:02,325 --> 02:14:04,035
What is?

1715
02:14:04,119 --> 02:14:05,454
The Batman.

1716
02:14:10,959 --> 02:14:12,127
Yeah?

1717
02:14:23,388 --> 02:14:24,639
Right.

1718
02:14:27,392 --> 02:14:31,480
Riddler's asking for you.
At Arkham.

1719
02:14:38,862 --> 02:14:40,405
You're a good cop.

1720
02:15:04,763 --> 02:15:07,849
I told you
I'd see you in hell.

1721
02:15:07,933 --> 02:15:10,018
What do you
want from me?

1722
02:15:10,101 --> 02:15:12,020
"Want"?

1723
02:15:12,103 --> 02:15:13,522
If only you knew how long

1724
02:15:13,605 --> 02:15:15,816
I've been waiting
for this day.

1725
02:15:16,942 --> 02:15:19,110
For this moment.

1726
02:15:19,194 --> 02:15:23,198
I've been invisible
my whole life.

1727
02:15:23,281 --> 02:15:26,076
I guess I won't be anymore,
will I?

1728
02:15:27,536 --> 02:15:29,913
They'll remember me now.

1729
02:15:29,996 --> 02:15:31,957
They'll remember both of us.

1730
02:15:42,300 --> 02:15:44,302
Bruce...

1731
02:15:47,138 --> 02:15:49,015
Wayne.

1732
02:15:51,309 --> 02:15:55,146
Bruce...

1733
02:15:56,565 --> 02:15:59,442
Wayne.

1734
02:16:10,495 --> 02:16:13,081
You know,
I was there that day.

1735
02:16:15,584 --> 02:16:17,335
The day the great Thomas Wayne

1736
02:16:17,419 --> 02:16:18,920
announced
he was running for mayor,

1737
02:16:19,004 --> 02:16:21,506
made all those promises.

1738
02:16:23,800 --> 02:16:25,427
Well, a week later
he was dead,

1739
02:16:25,510 --> 02:16:28,513
and everybody
just forgot about us.

1740
02:16:28,597 --> 02:16:32,309
All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.

1741
02:16:32,392 --> 02:16:36,188
Bruce Wayne, the orphan.

1742
02:16:36,771 --> 02:16:38,315
Orphan.

1743
02:16:43,904 --> 02:16:47,240
Living in some tower
over the park

1744
02:16:47,324 --> 02:16:50,201
isn't being an orphan.

1745
02:16:50,285 --> 02:16:55,665
Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.

1746
02:16:55,749 --> 02:16:57,375
Don't you tell me.

1747
02:16:59,878 --> 02:17:02,881
Do you know
what being an orphan is?

1748
02:17:02,964 --> 02:17:06,635
It's 30 kids to a room.

1749
02:17:06,718 --> 02:17:09,304
Twelve years old
and already a drophead,

1750
02:17:09,387 --> 02:17:10,972
numbing the pain.

1751
02:17:12,557 --> 02:17:13,850
You wake up screaming

1752
02:17:13,934 --> 02:17:18,229
with rats
chewing your fingers.

1753
02:17:18,313 --> 02:17:21,608
And every winter
one of the babies die

1754
02:17:21,691 --> 02:17:24,027
because it's so cold.

1755
02:17:25,278 --> 02:17:27,906
But, oh, no.

1756
02:17:30,659 --> 02:17:32,619
Let's talk
about the billionaire

1757
02:17:32,702 --> 02:17:34,204
with the lying, dead daddy,

1758
02:17:34,287 --> 02:17:36,957
because at least the money
makes it go down easy.

1759
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:38,083
Doesn't it?

1760
02:17:39,501 --> 02:17:41,586
Bruce...

1761
02:17:42,587 --> 02:17:44,547
Wayne.

1762
02:17:48,051 --> 02:17:51,304
He's the only one
we didn't get.

1763
02:17:54,516 --> 02:17:59,020
But we got the rest of 'em,
didn't we?

1764
02:17:59,104 --> 02:18:03,191
All those slick,
sleazy, phony pricks.

1765
02:18:06,278 --> 02:18:07,487
God.

1766
02:18:08,446 --> 02:18:09,781
Look at you.

1767
02:18:11,366 --> 02:18:13,743
Your mask is amazing.

1768
02:18:13,827 --> 02:18:16,871
I wish you could've
seen me in mine.

1769
02:18:16,955 --> 02:18:18,206
Ain't it funny?

1770
02:18:18,289 --> 02:18:20,542
All everyone wants to do
is unmask you,

1771
02:18:20,625 --> 02:18:22,585
but they're missing the point.

1772
02:18:23,962 --> 02:18:26,798
You and I both know,

1773
02:18:26,881 --> 02:18:29,384
I'm looking at the real you
right now.

1774
02:18:29,467 --> 02:18:31,720
My mask allowed me
to be myself,

1775
02:18:31,803 --> 02:18:33,221
completely.

1776
02:18:33,305 --> 02:18:34,889
No shame,

1777
02:18:35,765 --> 02:18:36,850
no limits.

1778
02:18:36,933 --> 02:18:38,560
Why did you write me?

1779
02:18:39,436 --> 02:18:40,520
What do you mean?

1780
02:18:40,603 --> 02:18:42,188
All those cards.

1781
02:18:42,272 --> 02:18:43,815
I told you,

1782
02:18:43,898 --> 02:18:44,983
we've been
doing this together.

1783
02:18:45,066 --> 02:18:46,317
You're a part of this.

1784
02:18:46,401 --> 02:18:47,277
We didn't do
anything together.

1785
02:18:47,360 --> 02:18:48,319
We did.

1786
02:18:48,403 --> 02:18:50,030
What did we just do?

1787
02:18:50,113 --> 02:18:51,948
I asked you to bring him
into the light, and you did.

1788
02:18:52,032 --> 02:18:53,199
We're such a good team.

1789
02:18:53,283 --> 02:18:54,617
We're not a team.

1790
02:18:54,701 --> 02:18:56,745
I never could have gotten him
out of there.

1791
02:18:56,828 --> 02:18:59,205
I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.

1792
02:18:59,289 --> 02:19:02,584
I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.

1793
02:19:02,667 --> 02:19:04,377
But I didn't know
how to make them listen.

1794
02:19:04,461 --> 02:19:05,712
You gave me that.

1795
02:19:05,795 --> 02:19:06,921
I gave you nothing.

1796
02:19:07,005 --> 02:19:09,299
You showed me
what was possible.

1797
02:19:09,382 --> 02:19:12,510
You showed me
all it takes is fear

1798
02:19:12,594 --> 02:19:14,471
and a little focused violence.

1799
02:19:14,554 --> 02:19:16,097
You inspired me.

1800
02:19:16,181 --> 02:19:17,766
You're out
of your goddamn mind.

1801
02:19:18,850 --> 02:19:20,351
What?

1802
02:19:20,435 --> 02:19:22,103
This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.

1803
02:19:22,187 --> 02:19:23,563
How can you say that?

1804
02:19:23,646 --> 02:19:25,148
You think
you'll be remembered?

1805
02:19:25,231 --> 02:19:27,275
You're a pathetic psychopath,

1806
02:19:27,358 --> 02:19:29,069
-begging for attention.
-No.

1807
02:19:29,152 --> 02:19:30,403
You're gonna die alone
in Arkham.

1808
02:19:30,487 --> 02:19:33,114
-No. No, no, no!
-A nobody!

1809
02:19:34,866 --> 02:19:36,701
No!

1810
02:19:38,620 --> 02:19:40,955
Ahhh!

1811
02:19:41,039 --> 02:19:43,833
This is not how
this was supposed to go!

1812
02:19:44,793 --> 02:19:48,296
Ahhh!

1813
02:19:48,379 --> 02:19:51,925
I had it all planned out!

1814
02:19:52,008 --> 02:19:54,260
We were gonna be safe here.

1815
02:19:54,344 --> 02:19:57,764
We could watch
the whole thing together.

1816
02:19:57,847 --> 02:19:58,932
Watch what?

1817
02:19:59,015 --> 02:20:00,767
Everything!

1818
02:20:08,983 --> 02:20:10,693
It was all there.

1819
02:20:12,654 --> 02:20:15,198
You mean,
you didn't figure it out?

1820
02:20:19,244 --> 02:20:23,414
Oh, you're really not as smart
as I thought you were.

1821
02:20:25,250 --> 02:20:27,836
I guess I gave you
too much credit.

1822
02:20:27,919 --> 02:20:29,671
What have you done?

1823
02:20:29,754 --> 02:20:34,843
What's black and blue
and dead all over?

1824
02:20:37,637 --> 02:20:39,472
You.

1825
02:20:40,974 --> 02:20:43,309
If you think you can stop
what's coming.

1826
02:20:44,561 --> 02:20:47,439
What have you done?

1827
02:20:47,522 --> 02:20:53,736
♪ Ave Maria ♪

1828
02:20:53,820 --> 02:20:55,822

What are you doing in here?

1835
02:22:07,519 --> 02:22:10,355
Hey, man, I don't think that
you should be touching that.

1836
02:22:16,736 --> 02:22:19,948
Boy, this guy's
a real nutjob, huh?

1837
02:22:20,031 --> 02:22:22,992
Killing Mitchell
with a friggin' carpet tool.

1838
02:22:27,538 --> 02:22:30,541
My uncle's a...
He's an installer.

1839
02:22:30,625 --> 02:22:32,877
You know, it's a...
Oh, you know.

1840
02:22:32,961 --> 02:22:35,296
It's a... a tucker.

1841
02:22:52,981 --> 02:22:53,982
Huh.

1842
02:23:09,122 --> 02:23:10,832
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

1843
02:23:10,915 --> 02:23:12,000
What are you doing?

1844
02:23:12,083 --> 02:23:13,626
What are you doing?

1845
02:23:44,115 --> 02:23:45,700
Hey, guys.

1846
02:23:45,783 --> 02:23:47,869
Uh, thanks
for all the comments,

1847
02:23:47,952 --> 02:23:49,537
and, uh, a special thanks
to everyone

1848
02:23:49,620 --> 02:23:51,080
for the tips on detonators.

1849
02:23:51,164 --> 02:23:52,373
Detonators?

1850
02:23:52,457 --> 02:23:53,875
I just want to say
this will be

1851
02:23:53,958 --> 02:23:57,337
my last post
for a little while, and, uh...

1852
02:23:59,422 --> 02:24:01,549
what this community
has meant to me

1853
02:24:01,632 --> 02:24:05,470
these weeks, these months,

1854
02:24:05,553 --> 02:24:08,097
let's just say none of us...

1855
02:24:09,724 --> 02:24:11,934
is alone anymore. Okay?

1856
02:24:12,644 --> 02:24:14,145
Jesus.

1857
02:24:18,483 --> 02:24:22,362
Tomorrow's Election Day.

1858
02:24:23,654 --> 02:24:26,407
And Bella Real will win.

1859
02:24:26,491 --> 02:24:29,577
She promised real change.

1860
02:24:29,661 --> 02:24:32,080
But we know the truth,
don't we?

1861
02:24:32,163 --> 02:24:34,248
You've seen
Gotham's true face now.

1862
02:24:34,332 --> 02:24:36,250
Together, we've unmasked it.

1863
02:24:36,334 --> 02:24:39,170
Its corruption, its perversion

1864
02:24:39,253 --> 02:24:43,216
masquerading
under the guise of renewal.

1865
02:24:43,299 --> 02:24:47,220
But unmasking is not enough.

1866
02:24:49,180 --> 02:24:53,393
The day of judgment
is finally upon us.

1867
02:24:53,476 --> 02:24:55,895
And now it is time

1868
02:24:56,896 --> 02:24:59,273
for retribution.

1869
02:24:59,357 --> 02:25:02,276
I've parked seven vans

1870
02:25:02,360 --> 02:25:04,821
all along the city seawall.

1871
02:25:05,947 --> 02:25:07,907
And on the big night,

1872
02:25:07,990 --> 02:25:10,243
they will go boom.

1873
02:25:24,215 --> 02:25:26,509
-Boom!

1874
02:25:31,013 --> 02:25:32,890
-Boom!

1875
02:25:35,059 --> 02:25:37,186
When the vans blow,

1876
02:25:37,270 --> 02:25:39,981
the flooding
will happen so fast,

1877
02:25:40,064 --> 02:25:43,151
evacuation
will not be an option.

1878
02:25:43,234 --> 02:25:46,154
Those who are not
washed away

1879
02:25:46,237 --> 02:25:48,656
will race through the streets
in terror.

1880
02:25:48,739 --> 02:25:50,616
-Call Gordon.

1881
02:25:50,700 --> 02:25:52,827
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1882
02:25:54,412 --> 02:25:56,539
As breaking news
hits higher ground

1883
02:25:56,622 --> 02:25:58,332
in Gotham Square Garden,

1884
02:25:58,416 --> 02:26:01,043
celebrations
will turn to panic,

1885
02:26:01,127 --> 02:26:02,795
as the venue becomes

1886
02:26:02,879 --> 02:26:06,007
the city's shelter
of last resort.

1887
02:26:07,467 --> 02:26:11,429
And that's where
all of you come in.

1888
02:26:17,560 --> 02:26:20,938
Now, when the time arrives,
I will already be unmasked.

1889
02:26:21,022 --> 02:26:23,357
The pigs will have me
in their custody,

1890
02:26:23,441 --> 02:26:25,359
but that's okay.

1891
02:26:25,443 --> 02:26:29,947
Because then
it will be your turn.

1892
02:26:30,031 --> 02:26:34,285
You'll be there, waiting.

1893
02:26:44,921 --> 02:26:47,798
It's time for the lies
to finally end.

1894
02:26:47,882 --> 02:26:52,386
False promises of renewal?

1895
02:26:52,470 --> 02:26:53,804
Change?

1896
02:26:53,888 --> 02:26:57,391
We'll give them real,
real change now.

1897
02:26:57,475 --> 02:27:00,853
We've spent our lives
in this wretched place,

1898
02:27:00,937 --> 02:27:02,980
suffering!

1899
02:27:03,064 --> 02:27:05,399
Wondering, "Why us?"

1900
02:27:05,483 --> 02:27:08,736
Now they will spend their
last moments wondering,

1901
02:27:08,819 --> 02:27:10,905
why them?

1902
02:27:10,988 --> 02:27:13,199
I can't get through!
The lines are down.

1903
02:27:18,704 --> 02:27:21,332
Hey, hey, hey! Road's closed!

1904
02:27:21,415 --> 02:27:23,042
I'm just trying
to get out of town, man!

1905
02:27:23,125 --> 02:27:26,045
Lady, we got bombs going off.
The whole city's flooding.

1906
02:27:26,128 --> 02:27:27,505
You're gonna have to go
inside the Garden

1907
02:27:27,588 --> 02:27:28,923
-with everyone else.

1908
02:27:37,723 --> 02:27:39,559
-Lieutenant, who's in charge?
-I really don't know.

1909
02:27:39,642 --> 02:27:41,143
We're just trying
to get a handle here, sir.

1910
02:27:41,227 --> 02:27:43,062
Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!

1911
02:27:43,145 --> 02:27:44,480
We got an active situation.

1912
02:27:44,564 --> 02:27:46,232
We need to sweep the building
for explosives

1913
02:27:46,315 --> 02:27:47,650
and get the mayor-elect out
of here, now. Where is she?

1914
02:27:47,733 --> 02:27:48,985
-I can take you there.
-Come!

1915
02:28:24,854 --> 02:28:26,314
If we don't close
the doors, we're gonna have...

1916
02:28:26,397 --> 02:28:27,648
-MCU.
-...huge problems.

1917
02:28:27,732 --> 02:28:29,150
The water's
already started to breach.

1918
02:28:29,233 --> 02:28:30,192
I thought this was a shelter
of last resort.

1919
02:28:30,276 --> 02:28:31,527
Yeah, for a hurricane,

1920
02:28:31,611 --> 02:28:33,237
but not if the whole seawall
comes down.

1921
02:28:33,321 --> 02:28:34,739
I am not gonna let
those people die out there.

1922
02:28:34,822 --> 02:28:36,449
All right.
I'll go calm down the crowd

1923
02:28:36,532 --> 02:28:38,159
-so we can get everyone in.
-It's not safe for you here.

1924
02:28:38,242 --> 02:28:39,660
We need to get you out,
Ms. Real.

1925
02:28:39,744 --> 02:28:41,704
-I'm not going anywhere.
-We're under attack, ma'am.

1926
02:28:41,787 --> 02:28:43,539
Exactly! That's the problem
with this city.

1927
02:28:43,623 --> 02:28:45,708
Everyone's afraid to stand up
and do the right thing,

1928
02:28:45,791 --> 02:28:46,792
but I'm not.

1929
02:28:46,876 --> 02:28:48,461
-Excuse me.
-Ma'am...

1930
02:28:53,549 --> 02:28:54,842
Everyone, everyone,

1931
02:28:54,925 --> 02:28:56,886
if I could just
get your attention.

1932
02:28:56,969 --> 02:28:59,472
Please!
I just need your attention!

1933
02:29:15,279 --> 02:29:16,447
You're okay!

1934
02:30:47,163 --> 02:30:49,832
Hey! Hey!
How do I get up there?

1935
02:30:49,915 --> 02:30:51,125
Follow me, sir.

1936
02:33:01,005 --> 02:33:02,506
No, no. It's okay.

1937
02:33:02,590 --> 02:33:03,674
It's okay.

1938
02:33:03,757 --> 02:33:05,926
-It's okay.

1939
02:33:07,469 --> 02:33:09,680
It's done now. It's done.

1940
02:33:12,349 --> 02:33:13,684
It's over.

1941
02:34:08,948 --> 02:34:10,032
Hey!

1942
02:34:10,115 --> 02:34:12,743
Hey! Hey, man, take it easy!

1943
02:34:12,826 --> 02:34:14,828
-Take it easy.

1944
02:34:14,912 --> 02:34:15,996
Easy.

1945
02:34:44,525 --> 02:34:45,651
Jesus.

1946
02:34:55,452 --> 02:34:57,162
Who the hell are you?

1947
02:35:01,375 --> 02:35:02,376
Me?

1948
02:35:05,504 --> 02:35:06,880
I'm Vengeance.

1949
02:38:39,468 --> 02:38:41,845
Wednesday,
November 6th.

1950
02:38:45,015 --> 02:38:46,975
The city is underwater.

1951
02:38:49,394 --> 02:38:51,271
The National Guard is coming.

1952
02:38:53,232 --> 02:38:56,485
Martial law is in effect,

1953
02:38:56,568 --> 02:38:58,403
but the criminal element
never sleeps.

1954
02:39:01,198 --> 02:39:04,910
Looting and lawlessness
will be rampant

1955
02:39:04,993 --> 02:39:08,622
in the parts of the city
no one can get to.

1956
02:39:08,705 --> 02:39:11,250
I can already see
things will get worse

1957
02:39:11,333 --> 02:39:12,626
before they get better.

1958
02:39:15,337 --> 02:39:18,715
And some will seize the chance
to grab everything they can.

1959
02:39:20,008 --> 02:39:21,969
We will rebuild.

1960
02:39:22,052 --> 02:39:24,054
But not just our city.

1961
02:39:24,137 --> 02:39:26,515
We must rebuild people's faith

1962
02:39:26,598 --> 02:39:28,350
in our institutions,

1963
02:39:28,433 --> 02:39:30,560
in our elected officials,

1964
02:39:30,644 --> 02:39:32,479
in each other.

1965
02:39:32,563 --> 02:39:35,691
Together, we will learn
to believe in Gotham again.

1966
02:39:40,237 --> 02:39:42,114
I'm starting
to see now.

1967
02:39:43,448 --> 02:39:45,742
I have had an effect here...

1968
02:39:47,703 --> 02:39:49,746
but not the one I intended.

1969
02:39:51,957 --> 02:39:55,168
Vengeance
won't change the past,

1970
02:39:56,420 --> 02:39:58,880
mine or anyone else's.

1971
02:40:01,258 --> 02:40:03,343
I have to become more.

1972
02:40:06,346 --> 02:40:08,932
People need hope.

1973
02:40:09,016 --> 02:40:11,476
To know
someone's out there for them.

1974
02:40:15,147 --> 02:40:16,898
The city's angry,

1975
02:40:17,774 --> 02:40:19,192
scarred,

1976
02:40:20,068 --> 02:40:21,361
like me.

1977
02:40:23,363 --> 02:40:26,700
Our scars can destroy us.

1978
02:40:26,783 --> 02:40:29,661
Even after the physical wounds
have healed.

1979
02:40:31,204 --> 02:40:33,040
But if we survive them,

1980
02:40:34,458 --> 02:40:36,418
they can transform us.

1981
02:40:38,170 --> 02:40:40,213
They can give us the power

1982
02:40:41,131 --> 02:40:42,674
to endure...

1983
02:40:43,967 --> 02:40:46,178
and the strength to fight.

1984
02:40:48,889 --> 02:40:50,891
We are live.
As you can see,

1985
02:40:50,974 --> 02:40:53,977
the masked vigilante
atop Gotham Square Garden,

1986
02:40:54,061 --> 02:40:55,479
helping to save the lives

1987
02:40:55,562 --> 02:40:57,356
-of hundreds of victims.

1988
02:40:57,439 --> 02:40:58,899
And now as first responders

1989
02:40:58,982 --> 02:41:00,484
desperately scramble
to help the injured,

1990
02:41:00,567 --> 02:41:02,944
a mysterious masked man
emerges,

1991
02:41:03,028 --> 02:41:05,489
heroically pulling the victims
right through that skylight...

1992
02:41:05,572 --> 02:41:08,158
Isn't that just terrible?

1993
02:41:09,493 --> 02:41:11,244
Him...

1994
02:41:11,328 --> 02:41:15,707
raining on your parade
like that?

1995
02:41:20,045 --> 02:41:22,130
What is it they say?

1996
02:41:23,215 --> 02:41:25,467
"One day you're on top...

1997
02:41:27,010 --> 02:41:28,679
the next,

1998
02:41:30,013 --> 02:41:32,432
you're a clown."

1999
02:41:34,309 --> 02:41:35,477
Well...

2000
02:41:37,062 --> 02:41:40,065
let me tell you,
there are worse things to be.

2001
02:41:42,317 --> 02:41:45,070
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.

2002
02:41:46,321 --> 02:41:48,198
You did so well.

2003
02:41:52,661 --> 02:41:53,703
And you know,

2004
02:41:55,247 --> 02:41:58,583
Gotham loves a comeback story.

2005
02:42:08,552 --> 02:42:10,303
Who are you?

2006
02:42:10,387 --> 02:42:12,973
Well,
that's the question,

2007
02:42:14,182 --> 02:42:15,350
isn't it?

2008
02:42:18,437 --> 02:42:20,856
Riddle me this...

2009
02:42:23,066 --> 02:42:25,819
"The less of them you have,

2010
02:42:25,902 --> 02:42:29,823
the more one is worth."

2011
02:42:35,245 --> 02:42:36,997
A friend.

2012
02:43:03,565 --> 02:43:04,983
-You're leaving.

2013
02:43:05,066 --> 02:43:06,193
Jesus.

2014
02:43:07,986 --> 02:43:09,696
Don't you ever just say hello?

2015
02:43:14,576 --> 02:43:16,036
Where will you go?

2016
02:43:17,454 --> 02:43:20,248
I don't know. Upstate.

2017
02:43:20,332 --> 02:43:22,083
Bludhaven, maybe.

2018
02:43:22,959 --> 02:43:23,960
Why?

2019
02:43:25,086 --> 02:43:26,379
You asking me to stay?

2020
02:43:33,220 --> 02:43:35,680
You know this place
is never gonna change.

2021
02:43:35,764 --> 02:43:38,433
With Carmine gone, it's only
gonna get worse for you.

2022
02:43:38,517 --> 02:43:40,435
There's gonna be a power grab.

2023
02:43:41,853 --> 02:43:43,021
It'll be bloody.

2024
02:43:43,647 --> 02:43:44,856
I know.

2025
02:43:46,566 --> 02:43:47,817
But the city can change.

2026
02:43:47,901 --> 02:43:49,110
It won't.

2027
02:43:50,153 --> 02:43:51,488
I have to try.

2028
02:43:51,571 --> 02:43:53,031
It's gonna kill you
eventually. You know that.

2029
02:43:55,325 --> 02:43:56,451
Listen.

2030
02:43:58,828 --> 02:44:00,163
Why don't you come with me?

2031
02:44:01,039 --> 02:44:03,124
Get into some trouble.

2032
02:44:03,208 --> 02:44:05,085
Knock off some
CEO hedge fund types.

2033
02:44:05,168 --> 02:44:07,420
It'll be fun.

2034
02:44:07,504 --> 02:44:09,047
The bat and the cat.

2035
02:44:10,590 --> 02:44:12,342
It's got a nice ring.

2036
02:44:25,605 --> 02:44:27,023
Who am I kidding?

2037
02:44:28,441 --> 02:44:30,652
You're already spoken for.

2038
02:44:42,497 --> 02:44:43,873
You should go.

2039
02:44:52,299 --> 02:44:53,300
Selina...

2040
02:44:57,304 --> 02:44:59,055
Take care of yourself.
